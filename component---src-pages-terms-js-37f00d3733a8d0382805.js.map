We have adopted\n            this privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") to explain what information\n            may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and\n            under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third\n            parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect\n            through the Website and does not apply to our collection of\n            information from other sources.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted\n            on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing\n            your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting\n            our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and\n            conditions.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Website Visitors</h3>\n          <p>\n            Like most website operators, CFP Land collects\n            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers\n            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,\n            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each\n            visitor request. CFP Land's purpose in collecting non-personally\n            identifying information is to better understand how CFP Land's\n            visitors use its website. From time to time, CFP Land may release\n            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by\n            publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            CFP Land also collects potentially personally-identifying\n            information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in\n            users and for users leaving comments on https://www.cfpland.com blog\n            posts. CFP Land only discloses logged in user and commenter IP\n            addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses\n            personally-identifying information as described below.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>\n          <p>\n            Certain visitors to CFP Land's websites choose to interact with CFP\n            Land in ways that require CFP Land to gather personally-identifying\n            information. The amount and type of information that CFP Land\n            gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we\n            ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://www.cfpland.com to\n            provide a username and email address.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Security</h3>\n          <p>\n            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but\n            remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method\n            of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use\n            commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information,\n            we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Advertisements</h3>\n          <p>\n            Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by\n            advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the\n            ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an\n            online advertisement to compile information about you or others who\n            use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among\n            other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will\n            be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of\n            cookies by CFP Land and does not cover the use of cookies by any\n            advertisers.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Links To External Sites</h3>\n          <p>\n            Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not\n            operated by us.

We strongly advise you to\n            review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you\n            visit.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the\n            content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites,\n            products or services.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Google AdWords for remarketing</h3>\n          <p>\n            CFP Land may use remarketing services to advertise on third party\n            websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It\n            could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't\n            completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to\n            make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on\n            the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display\n            Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve\n            ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected\n            will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's\n            privacy policy.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the\n            Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of\n            interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or\n            permanently using a browser plugin.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>\n          <p>\n            CFP Land may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to\n            its website.
