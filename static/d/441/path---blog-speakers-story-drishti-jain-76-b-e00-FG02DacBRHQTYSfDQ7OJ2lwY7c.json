How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w36pjbN.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I am Drishti Jain a Computer Engineer at heart and a technology enthusiast. I love to use technology to help the less fortunate. I am a social entrepreneur. I am the Co-founder and President of the non-profit organisation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samyakdrishtifoundation\">Samyak Drishti Foundation</a> which works in environment, education and healthcare sectors in 10 cities across India. I have been titled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoptimistcitizen/p/BdT0mVJnMhU/\">Eco-Warrior thrice by the Government of Maharashtra, India</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been a good orator since a young age. I got into public speaking at school in grade 4; when I had to give a speech on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (birth anniversary). Ever since, Iâ€™ve loved the stage and sharing knowledge with all. [Fun Fact: I also host music concerts sometimes :) ]</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely benefited my career. Itâ€™s allowed me to expand my network in ways that Iâ€™ve never imagined before!</p>\n<p>I got into conference speaking first by writing blog posts which eventually led to speaking at local meetups and then conferences. I like that by speaking at conferences I can help others learn. <strong>Itâ€™s really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever Iâ€™m talking about click with someone in a way that it hasnâ€™t before.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I gave my first conference talk not too long ago! Big shout out to CodeStock for allowing me the opportunity. Iâ€™m really happy with the way my talk turned out. I talk fast naturally and talk even faster when Iâ€™m nervous so I was worried that my 60-minute time slot would end up being closer to 20 minutes. I took my time and a couple deep breaths and managed to use up most of my allotted time though!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Iâ€™m still pretty new to the speaker circuit so Iâ€™ve only applied to around eight conferences. Iâ€™ve spoken at one so far and am currently on the waitlist for another. <strong>I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. Iâ€™m learning from each rejection I get.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I donâ€™t like to attend a session before my talk as I like to take that time to be by myself and compose my thoughts. Iâ€™ll typically run through my slides one last time but Iâ€™ll only do a visual run through - I wonâ€™t actually practice. I also like to take a minute or two to go somewhere on my own and give myself a little pep talk!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Go for it! You can never succeed if you donâ€™t try.</strong> Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and donâ€™t give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone whoâ€™s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really love watching Chloe Condonâ€™s talks. I love how she injects humor into them.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n3GHyWTaM8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Chloe Condon at DevXcon, 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?
