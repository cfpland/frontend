In this section, we’ll cover all the things you should know before and up to the moment you deliver your presentation.</p>\n<h2>1-3 Months Before the Conference</h2>\n<h3>1. Get permission from your employer</h3>\n<p>Not every employer is as generous about speaking. Some will make you take personal days when you go to a conference, and others will make you show your presentation to the PR or legal department first to ensure you aren’t saying anything untoward. On the other hand, some companies will be thrilled that you’re representing them as a speaker and giving them a little free visibility in the community.</p>\n<p>Either way, address it early, and figure out what you need to do to get their compliance.</p>\n<h3>2. Double check the dates with the organizers</h3>\n<p>Organizing a conference is hard work, and sometimes things have to change for unforeseen reasons. While rare, it’s possible that your session could be cut, the conference may have to change its start date or location, or it may get cancelled entirely.</p>\n<p>Before you spend any money or take time off work, double check with the organizers. They also may have a special process for you to go through in order to qualify for reimbursement.</p>\n<h3>3. Book flights and hotel rooms</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve touched base with the organizers, you can go ahead and book any flights or hotel rooms. If you haven’t already, now is the time to lock in who will be paying for the trip: the conference, your employer, or you personally.</p>\n<p>In my experience, less than half of the tech conferences listed on CFP Land cover travel and hotel cost for speakers (if you want to be sure they do, you can use the <a href=\"\">filters on CFP Land</a> to check before you apply).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Permission from your employer</li>\n<li>\n<p>Flight/hotel/dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“reach an agreement with the organizers on what level of reimbursement they’ll provide before you accept their offer. This is more important with international travel.” - <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0</a></li>\n<li>“if you’re going to combine the conference trip with vacation, I highly recommend doing the vacation after the conference, so you’re not stressed about your talk the whole time.” - <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Speaker dinner?</li>\n<li>Airport to venue transportation</li>\n<li>Attendee or speaker Slack?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1. Practice your presentation</h3>\n<p>While this is covered in more detail in the <a href=\"../presentation/\">section dedicated to creating your presentation</a>, it bears repeating. Plan time to practice your talk. You may make tweaks up until the week before, but at some point you’ll have to lock it down and practice. Work out your timings, and make sure it fits within the time slot given. </p>\n<h2>1-2 Weeks Before the Conference</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Conf schedule - where do you fit? What other talks do you want to see?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I also try to see as many other talks as I can, though I that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Appropriate clothing, haircut</li>\n<li>What kind of microphone will they have?</li>\n<li>\n<p>Read about the conf, audience, and speaker handbook:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Most conference organizers will create a speaker brief or handbook to convey all the key information to you about the event. They’ll cover things like who the audience is, the overall event theme, and the agreed title and content of your talk.” - <a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clicker or pointer?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Conference may provide it, may not.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Twitter hashtag</li>\n<li>\n<p>Equipment/adapters</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Display is not the only point to take into account. If you’re travelling in other countries, power plugs need to be taken care of as well. European countries are mostly compatible with one another, but watch out if you come to Northern America or UK.” - <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wifi?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“If your presentation requires network access, it’s your responsibility to make sure the Wifi will be good enough on-site. For that, I usually ask if there will be a Wifi network dedicated for speakers: I don’t have confidence in a shared one.” - <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Media?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“if you have any kind of interactivity or rich media in your presentation, you absolutely have to run through it with the organizer onsite before you go on stage.” - <a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Room?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“You should also figure out what room you’ll be speaking in — are you in the keynote slot, or in a tiny side-room? Will your talk be recorded? Some conferences only record certain tracks.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>When You Arrive at the Conference</h2>\n<h2>1-2 Hours Before Your Session</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrive at your session early</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get pumped up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage.
