While many tech conference speakers do it for their own personal development, some are specifically hired to speak, travel, and be a face for the community. That‚Äôs what Nicolas does now, but like all speakers, it‚Äôs taken a journey to get there. In today‚Äôs Speaker Story, we hear how Nicolas got started as well as some of his tips for new conference speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Nicolas Fr√§nkel, a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a>. My main job is to speak at conferences, so that people know about Hazelcast the In-Memory-Data-Grid and <a href=\"https://jet.hazelcast.org/\">Jet</a>. I‚Äôm also the point of contact for the community.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been a teacher for more than 20 years, given that the best way to learn is to teach. However, some subjects are not relevant in academia. I discovered the <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/\">Vaadin web framework</a>, and I was so enthralled by it that I wanted to show it to the members of my local Java User Group. That was 7 years ago.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EOLCiAD.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects! For example, last summer, I was feeling a bit down with so much travelling around. I arrived at my hotel just a couple of hours before a talk. I wasn‚Äôt happy to be there, but I went to give the talk. After that, I felt really better, all bad feelings had been washed away.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I started public speaking at my Java user group one evening. Soon afterwards, when I travelled for work, I started to propose local user groups to host my talk. Then, I took vacations to speak at international conferences. I did more and more of them. <strong>But at one point, I realized that was pretty dumb to be paid to do a dull job (consulting on development/architecture) while taking vacations to do something that I really liked.</strong> One year ago, I steered my career toward Developer Advocacy, which includes a large part of public speaking.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a tech guy, so in general I stick to technical subjects. They include Java - it has been my bread and butter for years, Kotlin, Spring and Spring Boot, DevOps, Kubernetes and of course, Hazelcast IMDG and Jet.</p>\n<p>I once did a motivational talk, but it was quite hard for me. I might do more organizational/management-related talks in the future, as I already wrote some related blog posts already. But it means going far out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first talk at my local user group very vividly.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I was used to teach, but to talk in front of your peers is very different. <strong>When teaching, you speak from a position of power; when speaking in front of your peers, they will judge you - in a good or a bad way, and it will have a lasting effect.</strong> For this reason, I had asked some good friends to come, and they did. The room was overflowing with people, with some sitting on the stairs. I was very nervous before the talk, and in the first few minutes. Then, just like when coding, I focused on the subject at hand and went ‚Äúinto the zone‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember the specifics afterwards, it was just ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I believe the talk went pretty well, as I remember people clapping, and thus it was a great experience that helped me apply to speak again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt keep the count of the number of conferences I‚Äôve submitted to, but to give you a rough idea, this year, I‚Äôll speak at a total of 68 conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have routine per se, but I like to be at my place and prepared far in advance (at least 20 minutes). Being early was useful for a conference at the earlier this year, when I noticed very early that the projector didn‚Äôt work, and I had to run to find someone to help me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Wow, answering this question could easily fill a book!</p>\n<p>Regarding impostor syndrome, the main advice would be the following: I often hear great and skilled people not submitting talks because they‚Äôre afraid they have nothing new to say. Well, if that would be the case, not many people would do public speaking. I believe on the opposite that <strong>most people have a unique experience and bring a unique viewpoint, even to subjects that have been spoken about a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>For finding conferences, I use <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a> and <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">sessionize.com</a>. They also allow to write your bio and abstract once, find your conferences, and then submit them at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>For the rest, I already wrote a post named <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Advices for junior conference speakers</a> that might be of interest. Expect more to come in the future.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I became exposed to the world of Developer Advocacy through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaruch\">Baruch Sadogursky</a>. He was the one that made me understand by his behavior that public speaking could be a job - or at least a part thereof.</p>\n<p>For the sheer number of talks, I need to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbuxman\">Josh Long</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. As the latter told when he introduced himself during a panel is: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Venkat, I live in a plane‚Äù. And then he passed the mic.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/\">blog where I publish a weekly post</a>. This is also where you can find <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/speaking/\">my list of talks</a>, present and future. For videos, I keep a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0EuBuKK-s1EL-K3okpYwR0QZbAPRVmEG\">list on Youtube</a>.

His first experience public speaking was talking about mainframes with a group of soldiers, and now he speaks regularly about cutting edge technology used in big data applications. Itai is in a great spot to speak on these topics too - his employer <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/\">Nielsen</a> has some truly large-scale data needs, which I imagine make for some interesting engineering problems.</p>\n<p>That said, the parts about speaking he enjoys most are the conversations and opportunities to learn from others. Read on to hear more about how Itai got into speaking and some of his tips for people considering giving their first talk.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tChR2X7.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Other than being married to Liron and a father to Yaara and Yuval, I‚Äôm also working at Nielsen, the data and measurement company. I work for a division called Nielsen Marketing Cloud, as the tech lead of the big data group (sometimes people confuse ‚Äútech lead‚Äù with ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù, so I wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/tech-lead-dont-you-mean-team-lead-c8bde92e38ab\">short post</a> to explain what I see as a tech lead üòÉ).</p>\n<p>In addition to that, I‚Äôm also a co-founder and a core team member of the Israeli chapter of <a href=\"https://www.womeninbigdata.org/\">Women in Big Data</a>.</p>\n<p>I actually got into public speaking more than 10 years ago, when I was invited to give a talk about Mainframes to a group of young soldiers during their basic programming course in the army. I really enjoyed it, and since then I‚Äôve had the chance to talk about various topics in several different forums, ranging from internal sessions, through local meetups, all the way to international conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>While speaking at conferences is not part of my job per se, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs beneficial for my career in the long run, but that‚Äôs definitely not the main reason for me to do it. The main reason is actually the fact that it gives me an opportunity to meet a lot of smart people and share my knowledge with them - I absolutely love it!</p>\n<p>There are two added bonuses for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I get to attend other talks and learn from others as well.</li>\n<li>After I give a talk, people come up to me and ask questions, which always leads to very interesting conversations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bottom line - speaking at conferences is an awesome experience.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>In the last 7 years or so, I‚Äôve been a big data developer and tech lead, so naturally I cover big data related topics, usually frameworks and tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Apache Druid.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve worked on data-centric systems since the early days of my career, and it‚Äôs funny how sometimes the terminology is similar, while the underlying technology has significantly evolved (e.g Mainframe batch jobs vs a Spark batch jobs). As a data engineer, it‚Äôs exciting to be able to use cutting-edge tools to process the ever-increasing amounts of data, and so is the opportunity to share with others how we actually use those tools.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I definitely remember that talk! It was a local conference about 2.5 years ago, where my colleague, Yakir Buskilla (who‚Äôs now our VP R&#x26;D), and I spoke about how we use Druid for interactive count-distinct queries at scale.</p>\n<p>It was the first time I gave a talk to such a large audience (about 400 people), and I was excited (and a bit nervous of course‚Ä¶). We got great feedback after the talk, so I guess you can say it went well.</p>\n<p>You can check out the video recording of that talk below (my part starts at 12:01 minutes):</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOIJEBIVFDY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúUsing Druid for Interactive Count Distinct Queries at Scale‚Äù with Yakir Buskilla and Itai Yaffe</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since I joined Nielsen, over 5 years ago, I applied to around 10 conferences, and was accepted to about 7 of them. 2019 has been extremely successful for me as a speaker, presenting and co-presenting at 5 different conferences throughout the year. I also speak at meetups and other forums quite often.</p>\n<p>And, I‚Äôve already started working on my applications for next year‚Äôs conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I arrive a few minutes earlier to the location I‚Äôm going to talk at, and make sure everything is set-up properly. I also keep a bottle of water close by (just in case). Last but not least, it‚Äôs always helpful to pick a positive thought or idea that can lift your spirit and energize you right before getting on stage. I sometimes use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM\">Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù</a> (apparently, this is even <a href=\"https://loudwire.com/queen-dont-stop-me-now-worlds-most-uplifting-song/\">backed by a scientific study</a>).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I can give, is to[read my blog post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/how-to-present-at-meetups-and-survive-and-what-does-freddie-mercury-have-to-do-with-it-614b22a7fa9b\">How to present at meetups and survive (and what does Freddie Mercury have to do with it?)</a> üòÉ</p>\n<p>But to summarize the tips from that post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Success doesn‚Äôt (usually) happen overnight, it takes a lot of work.</li>\n<li>Try to make your talk a story worth telling - people always want to hear real-life stories about how others have dealt with common challenges.</li>\n<li>Practice makes perfect - conduct a lot of dry-runs and get early feedback.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let criticism get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let yourself get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt forget to enjoy!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been to several conferences and seen many great speakers, but I really look up to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\">Holden Karau</a> - her talks are always awesome, funny and insightful!</p>\n<p>She‚Äôs involved in quite a few open-source projects, and it‚Äôs really impressive she‚Äôs able to contribute to the open-source community both in terms of coding and in terms of sharing her knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôd love to meet you at <a href=\"https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe\">Spark+AI Summit Europe</a> on October 15-17 in Amsterdam, where I‚Äôll be talking about <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session_eu19/stream-stream-stream-different-streaming-methods-with-apache-spark-and-kafka\">different streaming methods with Spark and Kafka</a>. Or, if you prefer London, you can join me at <a href=\"https://bigdataldn.com\">Big Data LDN</a> on November 13-14, where my VP R&#x26;D and I will be talking about <a href=\"https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/counting-unique-users-in-real-time-heres-a-challenge-for-you/\">how we use Druid for counting unique users in real-time</a>.</p>\n<p>If you happen to be based in Israel, you‚Äôre more than welcome to join our <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/The-Big-Web-Theory/\">R&#x26;D‚Äôs meetup group</a> and <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Big-Data-Israel/\">the Israeli chapter of Women in Big Data meetup group</a> (which is open to everyone, regardless of gender!).</p>\n<p>And last but not least, I invite you to connect via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/itaiy/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ItaiYaffe\">Twitter</a> or follow me on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@itai.yaffe\">Medium</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CXHhfJH.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm an Engineering Coach at Help Scout, and my daily job is to make sure that the engineers on my team are successful and that we‚Äôre shipping features that our customers love.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking at a young age. I did one-act plays in high school, and I also competed in <a href=\"https://www.uiltexas.org/speech/oral-interp/2019-20-uil-poetry-categories\">UIL poetry interpretation</a>. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity‚Äôs ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences!</p>\n<p>I give my talks because <strong>I believe that I have something to say that will help the attendees be better at the work they do</strong>. So, speaking is a way that I can help people, and helpfulness is one of my core values. There‚Äôs nothing better than the feeling I get when people come up to me after my talk (or sometimes weeks/months later) and tell me how it changed the way they thought about the topic. It‚Äôs even better when they share how it changed their behavior!</p>\n<p>Speaking isn‚Äôt part of my job, but it has greatly benefited my career. During job interviews, <strong>I‚Äôve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!</strong> While giving great talks alone wouldn‚Äôt have gotten me the offer, being qualified and a good speaker has been an incredible combination!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>My two primary topics are technology leadership and diversity and inclusion. My technology leadership talks draw on core principles as well as historical examples.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/leadership-lessons-from-the-agile-manifesto/\">Leadership Lessons from the Agile Manifesto</a> talk takes the values of the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and distills lessons for engineering managers and technical leads. I give easy to understand guidelines for making the tough decisions that leaders have to make when guiding engineering teams.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/technical-leadership-through-the-underground-railroad/\">Technical Leadership Through the Underground Railroad</a> talk uses the story of the daring John P. Parker who was a Conductor on the legendary Underground Railroad. I use his experience helping a group of enslaved people in 19th Century America escape from the Slave States to freedom.</p>\n<p>I give a talk with my wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons, called <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/managing-the-burnout-burndown/\">Managing the Burnout Burndown</a>, and we use the burndown chart used my many Agile teams as a metaphor for burning down stress. We describe how protecting your health, forming strong relationships, and removing distractions can help you avoid burn out.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/lending-privilege/\">Lending Privilege</a> talk describes how everyone has privilege and can use it to create a more diverse and inclusive technology industry. We can all help those who lack our privileges be more visible, have their voices heard, and get a chance to contribute their expertise to the software development process at our companies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at Podcamp Houston back in 2009. I think it went very well!</p>\n<p>My talk was called ‚ÄúRestoring Tech Cred to Houston‚Äù, and I made the case for Houston being an often overlooked tech hub when compared to other areas of the country like Silicon Valley, New York City, and Austin. One thing that‚Äôs important to know about this first talk was that I had the fortune of getting a lot of speaking experience as a normal part of my job. As an engineering manager, I did a lot of speaking as a person tasked with leading development teams. Of course, this work was done inside company walls and was not visible to the public. However, I found that when I did start public speaking I already had a great set of skills just from what I did at work.</p>\n<p><strong>So, if you‚Äôre a new speaker, you probably are more experienced than you realize if your job requires you to do a lot of communication (even if it‚Äôs just in small team meetings or Slack conversations).</strong></p>\n<p>My first large conference talk was at South by Southwest in 2010, and I went on to speak there several times. I started to really get serious about speaking at conferences when I did a Lightning Talk at OSCON in 2016. That‚Äôs when my public speaking work really began to take off!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I would guess over 500. I‚Äôve spoken at about 50 conferences so that tells you how tough the ratio of applications to acceptances can be.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a numbers game, and <strong>you shouldn‚Äôt let the rejection emails get you down</strong>. I‚Äôve spoken at conferences on three different continents, and I still regularly get rejected. Keep applying and refining your proposals. You‚Äôll start getting acceptances which usually lead to a higher acceptance rate.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine is meant to minimize variables and distractions as much as possible. I avoid drinking or eating anything two hours before my talk. That reduces the chance that I‚Äôll have an upset stomach or have to deal with digestion issues. I may drink coffee, but no later than 30 minutes before I go on stage (to avoid being too jittery).</p>\n<p>I make sure I‚Äôve been mic‚Äôd and have done a sound check and laptop check at least 30 minutes before my talk. I want to make sure that the mic is working, my slides are properly displayed on the screens, and my clicker (I use a <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote\">Logitech Spotlight</a>) and laptop are both fully charged.</p>\n<p>I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified. üòÉ</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you have something to say</strong>. Even an entry level talk can provide a ton of value. There is always someone who is new to the topic and needs help understanding the core concepts. Also, <strong>even people who are experts need reminders best practices and first principles</strong>. So, don‚Äôt count yourself out just because you think you‚Äôre not an expert.</p>\n<p>Second, pick one or two topics that you‚Äôre passionate about and use those for your talk proposals. You know you‚Äôre passionate about a topic if you‚Äôre already spending a lot of time reading about it, thinking about it, and debating it with people on Twitter. Wrap your talks around your passions. That way, you won‚Äôt get tired of your talks (it can happen over time), and the audience will sense your excitement. If you‚Äôre not excited about what you‚Äôre talking about, then how can the people in the seats get excited about you?</p>\n<p>Third, rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. I‚Äôve given a lot of talks, and I still get nervous. However, the best remedy I‚Äôve found for anxiety about stepping on stage is rehearse. You don‚Äôt have to memorize everything you‚Äôre going to say, but you need to have a solid idea of the journey you‚Äôre taking the audience on in your talk.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I look up to and have been inspired by so many speakers.
