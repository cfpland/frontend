I‚Äôm really glad Danielle Pollard - a fellow Chicagoan - got back to me to share\nher story.</p>\n<p>In addition to her professional work as an Agile Lead, Danielle has a passion for lifting up those in the community\nwho most need help. While she‚Äôs relatively new at speaking at conferences, Danielle has been winning speaking competitions\nsince grade school, so read on to hear some of her candid and helpful advice.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself.</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fPEc4sWvfbW3_Gu2gkuu5nhfr9ki_4l0\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm currently an Agile Coach for Spot Hero in Chicago. SpotHero is a digital parking reservation service that connects drivers looking to reserve and pay for parking spaces with parking lots, parking garages and valet services.</p>\n<p>I believe that trust is hands down the #1 force multiplier for high performance, and I‚Äôve used that belief to create results as a project management consultant and Lean/Agile transformation coach for best in class companies like UPS, Kohler, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Yellow-Roadway, RR Donnelley, Allstate, Apartments.com, US Foods.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm also working closely with <a href=\"http://fchnwecare.com/\">FCHN</a>, a Soup Kitchen on the south side of Chicago focused on feeding, clothing and helping the needy. FCHN has been serving the community with hot meals 6 days a week for over 32 years. They are struggling to keep the lights on and I‚Äôm determined to turn things around for them.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been able to impact the lives of hundreds of inner city youth and aspiring women entrepreneurs through nonprofits I work with, and in my non-existent ‚Äúspare time‚Äù you can find me reading, eating some juicy carnivorous meal (scotch included) or being a personal barber for my two boys.</p>\n<h3>How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>In 4th grade my teacher was fed-up with my antics and inability to remain quiet and stay in my seat during class so she encouraged me to participate in the upcoming Speech Contest. I did. I won. And won and won and won until I became the 2nd Place winner in the Chicago-Wide Oratory competition.</p>\n<p>Never looked back.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences because I get a chance to meet some pretty awesome like-minded professionals, learn from them and share my ideas. Mostly for the love of helping and inspiring others and that has definitely enhanced my work as an Agile Coach without a doubt!</p>\n<h3>What makes Agile team leadership such an interesting topic to you?</h3>\n<p>It‚Äôs exciting for me because I love building resilient and learning teams that are able to handle anything that comes their way with top notch skill, professionalism and an unwavering focus on delivering value to both the business and the customer. Change is the only constant and I help teams and companies embrace and leverage it as a competitive advantage.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It was for the Agile Professional Learning Network‚Äôs annual conference. It went a whole lot better than I thought. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but I showed up and did my best and people seemed to like that.</p>\n<p>What I remember most is that my mom came and sat right in the front. She was supposed to record it for me but ended up getting so caught up in the presentation she completely forgot.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine includes prayer and for some reason I always get one more brilliant idea that I try to add in at the last minute‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs about.</p>\n<p><strong>I also use lots of positive self-talk because I get extremely nervous.</strong> I remind myself to focus on the message and not me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I can give is just sharing four things that I always try to remember for myself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A seasoned speaker once told me, ‚Äúthe audience is actually rooting for you, because they‚Äôre thinking about if it were them and how unnerved they would be. They want you to do well.‚Äù</li>\n<li>If you didn‚Äôt belong here, you wouldn‚Äôt be here. So relax.</li>\n<li>Proper Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance‚Ä¶being prepared and practiced helps eliminate fear and build confidence.</li>\n<li>Be yourself. Authenticity goes a long way.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Yke3jpFDhT96A8qM5vGn1zAHS2bUBDSW\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a developer who spends most of his time coaching and educating other developers these days. My primary source of income is <a href=\"https://www.rubytapas.com/\">RubyTapas.com</a>, a subscription screencast site I created for developers nine years ago. I specialize in making frequent, short, tightly-edited videos that introduce developers to one new and useful idea at a time.</p>\n<p>I got started speaking around 2010. <strong>I think my biggest reason was that back then I was under the misapprehension that I was an introvert, and speaking seemed like a handy socialization hack.</strong> The idea was, if I give a talk, people will introduce themselves to me!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love public speaking for its own sake, and I also very much enjoy traveling and meeting people. Speaking is interesting because on the one hand, it has been instrumental to my career. But on the other hand, it‚Äôs hard to trace the individual strands of causality. <strong>Many of my most delightful opportunities have stemmed from friends I made at a conference years earlier.</strong></p>\n<h3>What makes the intersection of philosophy and software such an interesting topic to you?</h3>\n<p>I honestly believe that <strong>programming is fundamentally the practice applied philosophy.</strong> We use code to model ways of thinking about the world we live in. And when our code is used by large numbers of people, it impacts how they see the world.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs a lot of power, and a lot of responsibility. It‚Äôs also an opportunity: learning to think critically and intentionally about the philosophical nature of our work can reveal new ways to bring our values and our work into alignment.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I think my first-ever talk was at an open-source conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was about tools for remote work, and it was not well-attended üòÖ</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I used to meditate a bit to calm myself down, with limited success. These days my favorite way to get ready is to be distracted by a conversation with an attendee until the moment comes to go on stage.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit early, submit often.</li>\n<li>It‚Äôs OK to submit an abstract on a topic you want to understand better: getting accepted will give you a great excuse to learn about it!</li>\n<li>In both proposals and the talks themselves, lead with a problem, not with information. What is your ideal audience-member worried about or frustrated with?</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt agonize over long articles about all the things you need to remember in order to give a good talk. Give yourself permission to suck at every aspect of doing your talk except one. E.g. maybe you‚Äôll suck at slides, pacing, narrative arc, delivery‚Ä¶ BUT you‚Äôll have some really funny stories! Then, in later talks, pick ONE new aspect to do be better at each time.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-Q_dXVQM1c' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù[No Return: Moving beyond transactions in software and in life](<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Q</a></em>dXVQM1c)‚Äù by Avdi Grimm_</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

This week, I‚Äôm featuring my interview with Denise Yu, a\nSenior Software Engineer at GitHub who has found speaking to be a great springboard for her career in tech.</p>\n<p>Like many speakers I‚Äôve talked to over the past year, Denise comes from a nontraditional background, and is deeply passionate about helping\nother speakers get their starts. She also included some great recommendations for other speakers to watch, so be sure\nto look for that section towards the end.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm about to start a job as a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub, working on the Community &#x26; Safety team. I previously worked at Pivotal in their Cloud R&#x26;D business, where I wrote lots of YAML and pair-programmed everyday.</p>\n<p>I make tech art ‚Äî mostly, doodling things quickly when I‚Äôm watching people speak at conferences, but also cat-related doodles of technical concepts, at <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/art/\">deniseyu.io/art</a>. I started public speaking when I was about 12 years old, because at that time I thought I wanted to grow up and become a lawyer. I joined my school‚Äôs debate club, and spent about the next 12 years participating, judging, teaching, and facilitating competitive debate, Model UN, Mock Trial, and lots of other speaking-related extracurricular activities.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>For me, technical speaking has been a pretty significant career accelerator. I‚Äôve met gracious and talented engineers who I consider to be mentors and sponsors, and <strong>I‚Äôve been able to network my way into every single job I‚Äôve taken, after my first job in tech, either as a direct or indirect result of my participation in public speaking at meetups and conferences. There‚Äôs no such thing as being too junior when you‚Äôre brave enough to get up in front of an audience and share what you know.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking has never officially been part of my job, but I‚Äôve been lucky to have had employers who supported my speaking endeavors by granting me paid time off to travel to conferences.</p>\n<h3>What makes distributed systems such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>I career-switched and didn‚Äôt study computer science in undergrad, so I have a persistent sense of imposter syndrome around missing out on foundational knowledge.</p>\n<p>I started becoming interested in the mechanics of distributed computing while debugging RabbitMQ issues in production a few years ago. I can‚Äôt remember the specifics now, but a customer experienced a network partition, and the RabbitMQ cluster nodes came back to life in an unexpected order, which caused a host of unexpected side effects.</p>\n<p>I had such poor understanding of the design decisions for partition recovery strategies, that I decided to start doing my own research, and uncovered a world of deep, deep academic research into resilience engineering for distributed systems. For someone with no computer science background, I found the reading material out there to be targeted at advanced practitioners, and it was so difficult to me to get started on learning about distsys, so I did the reasonable thing, which was to submit a talk proposal to DevOpsDays London promising to compare partition recovery strategies between a few popular open-source databases. (Side note: This was not a reasonable thing to do.)</p>\n<p>While I was writing this talk, I was also reading Martin Kleppmann‚Äôs book ‚ÄúDesigning Data-Intensive Applications‚Äù, and I realized that before I could even talk about network partition recovery strategies, I had to spend a significant amount of time laying groundwork around why these strategies even needed to exist in the first place. The talk evolved from ‚ÄúRabbitMQ vs. Kafka vs. Cassandra‚Äù into a more general discussion of why distributed systems are so hard to understand, operate, and maintain. I think that as this talk has further iterated and evolved, the constant thread has been that distributed systems are difficult to learn about, and there is always space to revisit the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I spoke at was SwanseaCon in 2017. I delivered a talk titled ‚ÄúBuilding Empowered Teams at Scale‚Äù. I am not sure if it was recorded, but <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/talks\">the slides are available on my website</a>.</p>\n<p>I pitched the talk because in my first few months at Pivotal, I saw that the product teams were so much more empowered to make their own decisions, than previous teams I‚Äôd worked on, and I thought that some pieces of our philosophy around building and managing teams would be interesting to share with the world.</p>\n<p><strong>I was terrified - not about presenting in public, but specifically about speaking to a room full of engineers who knew a lot more about software and organizations than I did.</strong> I remember being so nervous about the talk that I started writing it seven months in advance. My manager helped me connect with people in leadership within the org to interview about their perspectives ‚Äî which actually ended up being a really cool way to build rapport with very senior-level folks that I didn‚Äôt have day-to-day contact with.</p>\n<p>I think the talk went well - to be honest, my brain completely blurs out the exact memories of being on stage usually - but I was proud that I had pushed myself to pitch, create, and deliver a full-length conference talk, about 2.5 years into my career in tech so far.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I‚Äôve spoken at upwards of 20 conferences. I‚Äôve applied to more - I think I applied to 10 conferences last year and got accepted to 7. This year I‚Äôve been recycling talks and being less ambitious about submitting, because I‚Äôm switching jobs and want to invest my energy in getting ramped up.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>When I develop a new talk, I spend a lot of time doing research. I actually <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/2018/09/24/writing-tech-talks.html\">blogged about my process here</a>!</p>\n<p>As a former debate kid, <strong>the key thing that‚Äôs always worked for me is practicing in front of diverse test audiences before the big day.</strong> When I lived in London and was developing new talks regularly, I had a crew of tech friends who didn‚Äôt work with me at Pivotal, and I‚Äôd invite them over, cook them dinner, feed them wine and beer, and run my talk for them and ask for feedback. This always caught ‚ÄúPivotal-isms‚Äù that I subconsciously put in, and it‚Äôd be a good way to level-set about whether my talk made sense to people who didn‚Äôt work on the same types of software that I did.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I also have decks on this! I sometimes help local meetups with training new speaker and drumming up talk submissions for CFPs. <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/techtalks\">Here‚Äôs the 15-minute deck that I usually run</a>.</p>\n<p>For new speakers, particularly folks with non-linear trajectories into the tech industry like myself, I always tell them this: <strong>Your story is interesting. You have a unique voice and set of experiences, and someone out there wants to hear your story.</strong></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs great to get started with smaller and lower-pressure speaking environments like meetups and possibly even presenting to bootcamp students or university student groups.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQrNOMO7UDk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQrNOMO7UDk\">How to Tech Talk</a>‚Äù by Denise Yu</em></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

Early Access to CFPs</span></h2>\n<p>The weekly CFP Land newsletter and <a href=\"/conferences/\">our free conference listings</a> show all CFPs that close in the next 21 days. Usually this is plenty of time to apply, but many conferences review applicants on a rolling basis. In those cases, <strong>applying as early as possible is advantageous</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular features among Pro Members is the early access to CFPs. If you‚Äôre not a Pro Member already, you won‚Äôt see any conferences tagged <code class=\"language-text\">‚¨ÜÔ∏è Pro</code> in your feed, but if you sign up for a Pro Membership, here‚Äôs what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png\" alt=\"Pro Members get access to CFPs 21 days before free members\"></a></p>\n<p>As a Pro Member, you can see all the CFPs in our database that are closing in the next <strong>42 days</strong>, meaning you‚Äôll be able to apply much earlier than free users.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"save-cfps\">2.

This is great if you‚Äôre browsing CFPs on mobile, but you don‚Äôt want to forget to submit to them when you‚Äôre back at your computer.</p>\n<p>Another useful reason to save CFPs is to personalize your feed of upcoming Calls for Proposals. By default, there may be 50 to 100 open CFPs on the ‚ÄúAll‚Äù page, so saving CFPs will ensure you don‚Äôt have to wade through quite as many irrelevant conferences.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"export-cfps\">3.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cuCV5BH66UNiamgKS4EyAPZgD8Vpiro-\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am currently a Senior Engineering Manager at Target Corp in Minneapolis, MN. I lead a team of amazing Engineers who build tools for our global supply chain users. Outside of my day job, I founded a company called Developer First to help organizations around the world build strong Engineering teams which I believe starts with developing confident, purposeful and inspiring leaders.</p>\n<p>I was absolutely terrified of public speaking throughout college and into the first couple years of my professional career. I avoided it at all costs and was a terrible speaker in front of an audience of any size. I eventually realized that I couldn‚Äôt continue avoiding public speaking and joined my organization‚Äôs Toastmaster‚Äôs club. I was thrilled to discover a safe and comfortable environment to practice my new skills and overcome my fears. I spent a couple years as a practicing member before being elected President of my local chapter.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is not a requirement of my role, but I enjoy the opportunity to connect with leaders outside of my organization and feel like I am inspiring and influencing others to reflect and potentially shift their mindsets on technical leadership.</p>\n<p><strong>My favorite experiences of speaking at conferences are the conversations I have with folks who approach me after my talk.</strong> It is very rewarding to hear how my ideas resonated with them and even more enjoyable when they share new ideas that I hadn‚Äôt thought of!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I speak about a variety of topics related to the unique challenges of being an engineering leader: people first leadership, time management, prioritization, effective communication, coaching developers, diversity &#x26; inclusion, effective on boarding programs, etc.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was part of an executive track at an engineering conference in NYC. I talked so fast that I finished my 45 minute talk in 20 minutes. I remember arriving to the speaker staging room 90 minutes early because I was so nervous that I would be late or not find the location. My confidence and skills were definitely lacking. However, I don‚Äôt regret any of it! I was passionate about the topic and strongly believe that you have to start somewhere. No video footage exists (thank goodness).</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied: hundreds</p>\n<p>Spoken at: ~25</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ut7jEkIf1ac' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7jEkIf1ac\">Developer First Leadership</a>‚Äù by Kate Wardin at React Boston</em></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I usually run through the slides about an hour before my talk. <strong>The more familiar the ideas are, the more comfortable I am.</strong> After that, I try to relax and maybe go introduce myself to other attendees during the break before my talk.</p>\n<p>Another tip: make sure you check what type of projector or input is needed before you arrive to speak!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DON‚ÄôT WAIT. START WITH ANYTHING.</strong> Submit topics that you feel even somewhat confident to present on, and then invest the time to fully research, compile content, and practice(!!). It is amazing how your idea will flourish and grow the longer you have to reflect on the topic, gather feedback, and learn through other experiences. You just need to start with something - anything that you are passionate about. If you have an idea swirling in your head for longer than a couple weeks, take some time to start drafting an abstract and outline.</li>\n<li>Make sure you propose a topic that you are passionate about. There is nothing worse than a dull speaker who isn‚Äôt personally energized by the topic.</li>\n<li>READING THE ROOM: <strong>Nothing kills confidence faster than making eye contact with members of the audience who seem skeptical or not engaged.</strong> I like to find the person (or people) that actively shows feedback (nods, smiles) and focus my attention on them throughout my talk. As for those skeptics, I have found that it is dangerous to interpret the non-verbals of humans that you don‚Äôt personally know. In fact, on several occasions, some of those ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù (or so I thought) approached me after my talk and expressed gratitude and shared that they loved my topic.</li>\n<li>Join a frequent flyer/hotel chain rewards program. Admittedly, I also got into conference speaking because I wanted an excuse to travel more and rack up those airline/hotel points. Check and check.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.developer-first.com/\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-wardin/\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/developer_first\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upcoming talks: NoFluffJustStuff US tour, StretchCon Budapest, &#x26; Developer First Tech Leadership Conference</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

There‚Äôs something unifying about knowing that technologists from every corner of the globe can meet together to offer their tips and thoughts to others, and Vincenzo mentioned a similar appreciation in his interview here. As a speaker, he‚Äôs gotten to travel across the world to give talks on a variety of topics. Vincenzo‚Äôs approach to coming up with new talk ideas is also really interesting.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/G2DRaCN.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Vincenzo Chianese, I am an Italian Software Developer that‚Äôs been working for the last 5 years in the WebAPIs space, providing tools for API Developers. I mostly code in TypeScript/JavaScript these days, but previously I‚Äôve worked with C#, C++ and VB6. I am an Auth0 Ambassador and a Google Developer Expert in WebTechnologies and I‚Äôve been living in Prague, Madrid and (starting in January) in Austin, TX.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The ability to travel and see new places. I think I‚Äôve been able to go on all the continents just because of the speaking engagements I had, which would have been impossible otherwise.</p>\n<p>Second? Networking with speakers; <strong>I met some of my best contacts I have in the space because of the conferences,</strong> and I even ended up organising a conference because of some people I met in Paris last year. You never know who you‚Äôre talking to ‚Äî and you can be surprised. Curiously enough, the content is really the last reason I‚Äôd go to a conference.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I have always refused to present basic-level stuff that you can easily find on the web (tutorials and documentation) or even worse marked products for the company I work for. <strong>So every 8-10 months I do kind of a retrospective of what I‚Äôve been working on and if I see a fit for an interesting talk (such as something that you don‚Äôt exactly do everyday, something that has never been treated elsewhere)</strong> ‚Äî I put up an abstract and a title and try to submit it around.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the topic is appreciated, but most of the times it is not. My point is ‚Äî I want to share experiences, not technical documents in an oral form.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I totally remember it. It was in 2015 at the mDevCamp and I was asked to replace a colleague that couldn‚Äôt make it. I was in an horrible condition (I had fever) and it was at the very last moment. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the company unrepresented to I took the bet and had the presentation anyway.</p>\n<p>I must say, my English has improved since then, I promise.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYvsept0oio' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://slideslive.com/38894088/building-resilient-api-client\">Building resilient API client</a>‚Äù by Vincenzo Chianese at mDevCamp</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>In general, I apply to everything that makes sense, no matter the location or the timing of the year; that‚Äôs something I prefer to figure out later. Although I had a lot of speaking engagements, I still get rejected by default by most of the events. Some conference organisers that I met personally saw that I usually bring solid topics and so they were kind enough to invite me back. Anyway, I think my ratio is 1/5 (every 5 submissions, one goes through and gets accepted). You can do the math.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I found myself in the world of the conferences accidentally and I had basically no training. Here are some things I wish I would have done before doing this serially and seriously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find a local Meetup in your native language. You need to get confident in front of the crowd and the meet-ups are perfect: low expectations, willingness to listen from the audience and the ‚Äúeven-if-everything-fails-nothing-happens‚Äù guarantee that will make you feel comfortable. Rinse and repeat 2-3 times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find a meetup in English, and try the same talk. You will probably have to pay for your own flight (although a lot of meetups in Europe give talks in English anyway), but it‚Äôs an investment, so totally worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time to apply to a conference.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I‚Äôve also wrote a small essay on what to keep in mind when sending a CFP to a conference, <a href=\"https://dev.to/vncz/a-reviewer-s-perspective-on-getting-your-conference-proposal-accepted-1e6p\">sharing some thoughts as an organiser</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rNiq6xr.png?1\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://crate.io/\">Crate.io</a> which means I am working closely with the community of engineers using CrateDB. I am speaking at a lot at conferences, holding webinars, writing tutorials and articles. I got into public speaking after joining a program called <a href=\"https://events.mozilla.org/techspeakers\">Mozilla Tech Speakers</a>. I gave my first talk in 2016 in Russia.</p>\n<p>I have been going to conferences for a while now and I have met some truly amazing speakers from whom I have learnt a lot. I thought, why not record our conversations and make them available as a podcast so that a lot more people can benefit from it? This is a side project that is very dear to me on which I am concentrating on these days. It is called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">Technically True</a> and I chat with inspiring people in the industry to gain insights on topics related to public speaking and developer relations.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Initially, one of the strongest incentives was travelling to new places. Over time, the thing I liked the most about this was meeting new developer communities, engaging with them and of course, speaking and sharing what I have been working on.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences helped me gain more exposure and until the end of 2018, it was something that I did just for fun. Then I realised that I used up almost all of my vacation days for speaking at conferences and that now maybe it is time that I should do this full-time. That is when I decided to quit my job and join Crate.io this year as a full-time Developer Advocate. It‚Äôs been almost a year that speaking has been a part of my daily work and I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>These days, I have been speaking a lot about databases, industry 4.0, machine and time-series data. I especially enjoy talking about case-studies related to IoT that we do with our clients. I also speak on WebXR with A-Frame and building multiplayer games with that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Sure, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was very thrilled about it but got very nervous the day before I had to give the talk. I experienced a cocktail of feelings like impostor syndrome, adrenaline rush and anxiety. Once I started speaking, I realised that I was really enjoying it and all the fear melted away. The talk went well, I had a lot of questions and the feedback was good. I watched the recorded video later on and identified a lot of things that I had to fix like filler words and so on. It‚Äôs not easy to watch a video of your talk but trust me, it can be the best way to improve your speaking skills. I even have a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZTJOhz6INQ\">my first talk on YouTube</a>, it helps me realize how far I have come and how far I still have to go.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZTJOhz6INQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúGetting Started With Web Based Virtual Reality‚Äù by Tanay Pant (his first conference talk)</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied to? Hundreds! Spoken at? I think it is probably close to twenty-five.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that is the most important for me is putting my Slack, laptop and mobile on do not disturb. I always take off my watch before going on the stage - loose watches can create a distraction for both the speakers and the audience by going up and down the wrist. Smartwatches on the other hand can light up with hand movements. I use an app called HiddenMe for hiding all the icons, files and folders from my Desktop, especially if I have to give a demo and need to exit Powerpoint. I think that it‚Äôs important to have a bottle of water on the stage especially for longer talks.</p>\n<p>I recently talked about pre-talk rituals with Niels Leenheer and you can hear stories from us about the things we do and why we do them <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">in the episode coming out on December 1</a>.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Well, there‚Äôs SO many things. Let‚Äôs go through a speaker‚Äôs journey from picking a topic to chatting with the audience at the end of the talk.</p>\n<p>First of all, topic selection. It‚Äôs most important to choose something really interesting to you, something that you are passionate about. That plays a huge factor in how much confidence and enthusiasm you have when you are up on the stage. If you‚Äôd like to know more about CFPs and how conferences select talks, I can highly recommend following <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/talk-selection-in-conferences-with-kristina-schneider\">Kristina Schneider‚Äôs advice</a> on the topic (she organises CSSConfEU).</p>\n<p>Once your talk is ready, make sure to practice it well but also beware of over-rehearsing. Practising your talk a couple of times helps you to further tailor your talks and make them leaner. It also helps you with your confidence on stage in case something goes sideways.</p>\n<p>If something doesn‚Äôt go exactly as you wanted to on the stage or if the demo fails, make a joke about it and move on. Make sure that you have a video that you can show in its place. Don‚Äôt let it affect the rest of your talk and your morale. Things go wrong, it‚Äôs okay. This happens to everybody.</p>\n<p>Make sure you stick around after you talk to answer the questions from the audience and help them in any way you can. <strong>Never forget that the audience is the most important group in that room and always be humble.</strong> I can go on about this topic for hours, if you have more questions DO reach out to me.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One of the talks that have inspired me the most was given by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mio_Loclair\">Christian Mio Loclair</a> in Berlin about <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/273373088\">Narciss</a> back in 2018. Having said that, there are a countless number of people who have inspired me and I usually end up inviting them to my podcast. üòÖ</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am most active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanay1337\">Twitter</a> but I can also be found on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337\">LinkedIn</a>.

While many tech conference speakers do it for their own personal development, some are specifically hired to speak, travel, and be a face for the community. That‚Äôs what Nicolas does now, but like all speakers, it‚Äôs taken a journey to get there. In today‚Äôs Speaker Story, we hear how Nicolas got started as well as some of his tips for new conference speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Nicolas Fr√§nkel, a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a>. My main job is to speak at conferences, so that people know about Hazelcast the In-Memory-Data-Grid and <a href=\"https://jet.hazelcast.org/\">Jet</a>. I‚Äôm also the point of contact for the community.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been a teacher for more than 20 years, given that the best way to learn is to teach. However, some subjects are not relevant in academia. I discovered the <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/\">Vaadin web framework</a>, and I was so enthralled by it that I wanted to show it to the members of my local Java User Group. That was 7 years ago.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EOLCiAD.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects! For example, last summer, I was feeling a bit down with so much travelling around. I arrived at my hotel just a couple of hours before a talk. I wasn‚Äôt happy to be there, but I went to give the talk. After that, I felt really better, all bad feelings had been washed away.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I started public speaking at my Java user group one evening. Soon afterwards, when I travelled for work, I started to propose local user groups to host my talk. Then, I took vacations to speak at international conferences. I did more and more of them. <strong>But at one point, I realized that was pretty dumb to be paid to do a dull job (consulting on development/architecture) while taking vacations to do something that I really liked.</strong> One year ago, I steered my career toward Developer Advocacy, which includes a large part of public speaking.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a tech guy, so in general I stick to technical subjects. They include Java - it has been my bread and butter for years, Kotlin, Spring and Spring Boot, DevOps, Kubernetes and of course, Hazelcast IMDG and Jet.</p>\n<p>I once did a motivational talk, but it was quite hard for me. I might do more organizational/management-related talks in the future, as I already wrote some related blog posts already. But it means going far out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first talk at my local user group very vividly.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I was used to teach, but to talk in front of your peers is very different. <strong>When teaching, you speak from a position of power; when speaking in front of your peers, they will judge you - in a good or a bad way, and it will have a lasting effect.</strong> For this reason, I had asked some good friends to come, and they did. The room was overflowing with people, with some sitting on the stairs. I was very nervous before the talk, and in the first few minutes. Then, just like when coding, I focused on the subject at hand and went ‚Äúinto the zone‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember the specifics afterwards, it was just ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I believe the talk went pretty well, as I remember people clapping, and thus it was a great experience that helped me apply to speak again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt keep the count of the number of conferences I‚Äôve submitted to, but to give you a rough idea, this year, I‚Äôll speak at a total of 68 conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have routine per se, but I like to be at my place and prepared far in advance (at least 20 minutes). Being early was useful for a conference at the earlier this year, when I noticed very early that the projector didn‚Äôt work, and I had to run to find someone to help me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Wow, answering this question could easily fill a book!</p>\n<p>Regarding impostor syndrome, the main advice would be the following: I often hear great and skilled people not submitting talks because they‚Äôre afraid they have nothing new to say. Well, if that would be the case, not many people would do public speaking. I believe on the opposite that <strong>most people have a unique experience and bring a unique viewpoint, even to subjects that have been spoken about a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>For finding conferences, I use <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a> and <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">sessionize.com</a>. They also allow to write your bio and abstract once, find your conferences, and then submit them at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>For the rest, I already wrote a post named <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Advices for junior conference speakers</a> that might be of interest. Expect more to come in the future.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I became exposed to the world of Developer Advocacy through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaruch\">Baruch Sadogursky</a>. He was the one that made me understand by his behavior that public speaking could be a job - or at least a part thereof.</p>\n<p>For the sheer number of talks, I need to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbuxman\">Josh Long</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. As the latter told when he introduced himself during a panel is: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Venkat, I live in a plane‚Äù. And then he passed the mic.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/\">blog where I publish a weekly post</a>.

His first experience public speaking was talking about mainframes with a group of soldiers, and now he speaks regularly about cutting edge technology used in big data applications. Itai is in a great spot to speak on these topics too - his employer <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/\">Nielsen</a> has some truly large-scale data needs, which I imagine make for some interesting engineering problems.</p>\n<p>That said, the parts about speaking he enjoys most are the conversations and opportunities to learn from others. Read on to hear more about how Itai got into speaking and some of his tips for people considering giving their first talk.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tChR2X7.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Other than being married to Liron and a father to Yaara and Yuval, I‚Äôm also working at Nielsen, the data and measurement company. I work for a division called Nielsen Marketing Cloud, as the tech lead of the big data group (sometimes people confuse ‚Äútech lead‚Äù with ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù, so I wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/tech-lead-dont-you-mean-team-lead-c8bde92e38ab\">short post</a> to explain what I see as a tech lead üòÉ).</p>\n<p>In addition to that, I‚Äôm also a co-founder and a core team member of the Israeli chapter of <a href=\"https://www.womeninbigdata.org/\">Women in Big Data</a>.</p>\n<p>I actually got into public speaking more than 10 years ago, when I was invited to give a talk about Mainframes to a group of young soldiers during their basic programming course in the army. I really enjoyed it, and since then I‚Äôve had the chance to talk about various topics in several different forums, ranging from internal sessions, through local meetups, all the way to international conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>While speaking at conferences is not part of my job per se, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs beneficial for my career in the long run, but that‚Äôs definitely not the main reason for me to do it. The main reason is actually the fact that it gives me an opportunity to meet a lot of smart people and share my knowledge with them - I absolutely love it!</p>\n<p>There are two added bonuses for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I get to attend other talks and learn from others as well.</li>\n<li>After I give a talk, people come up to me and ask questions, which always leads to very interesting conversations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bottom line - speaking at conferences is an awesome experience.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>In the last 7 years or so, I‚Äôve been a big data developer and tech lead, so naturally I cover big data related topics, usually frameworks and tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Apache Druid.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve worked on data-centric systems since the early days of my career, and it‚Äôs funny how sometimes the terminology is similar, while the underlying technology has significantly evolved (e.g Mainframe batch jobs vs a Spark batch jobs). As a data engineer, it‚Äôs exciting to be able to use cutting-edge tools to process the ever-increasing amounts of data, and so is the opportunity to share with others how we actually use those tools.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I definitely remember that talk! It was a local conference about 2.5 years ago, where my colleague, Yakir Buskilla (who‚Äôs now our VP R&#x26;D), and I spoke about how we use Druid for interactive count-distinct queries at scale.</p>\n<p>It was the first time I gave a talk to such a large audience (about 400 people), and I was excited (and a bit nervous of course‚Ä¶). We got great feedback after the talk, so I guess you can say it went well.</p>\n<p>You can check out the video recording of that talk below (my part starts at 12:01 minutes):</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOIJEBIVFDY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúUsing Druid for Interactive Count Distinct Queries at Scale‚Äù with Yakir Buskilla and Itai Yaffe</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since I joined Nielsen, over 5 years ago, I applied to around 10 conferences, and was accepted to about 7 of them. 2019 has been extremely successful for me as a speaker, presenting and co-presenting at 5 different conferences throughout the year. I also speak at meetups and other forums quite often.</p>\n<p>And, I‚Äôve already started working on my applications for next year‚Äôs conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I arrive a few minutes earlier to the location I‚Äôm going to talk at, and make sure everything is set-up properly. I also keep a bottle of water close by (just in case). Last but not least, it‚Äôs always helpful to pick a positive thought or idea that can lift your spirit and energize you right before getting on stage. I sometimes use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM\">Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù</a> (apparently, this is even <a href=\"https://loudwire.com/queen-dont-stop-me-now-worlds-most-uplifting-song/\">backed by a scientific study</a>).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I can give, is to[read my blog post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/how-to-present-at-meetups-and-survive-and-what-does-freddie-mercury-have-to-do-with-it-614b22a7fa9b\">How to present at meetups and survive (and what does Freddie Mercury have to do with it?)</a> üòÉ</p>\n<p>But to summarize the tips from that post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Success doesn‚Äôt (usually) happen overnight, it takes a lot of work.</li>\n<li>Try to make your talk a story worth telling - people always want to hear real-life stories about how others have dealt with common challenges.</li>\n<li>Practice makes perfect - conduct a lot of dry-runs and get early feedback.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let criticism get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let yourself get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt forget to enjoy!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been to several conferences and seen many great speakers, but I really look up to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\">Holden Karau</a> - her talks are always awesome, funny and insightful!</p>\n<p>She‚Äôs involved in quite a few open-source projects, and it‚Äôs really impressive she‚Äôs able to contribute to the open-source community both in terms of coding and in terms of sharing her knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôd love to meet you at <a href=\"https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe\">Spark+AI Summit Europe</a> on October 15-17 in Amsterdam, where I‚Äôll be talking about <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session_eu19/stream-stream-stream-different-streaming-methods-with-apache-spark-and-kafka\">different streaming methods with Spark and Kafka</a>. Or, if you prefer London, you can join me at <a href=\"https://bigdataldn.com\">Big Data LDN</a> on November 13-14, where my VP R&#x26;D and I will be talking about <a href=\"https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/counting-unique-users-in-real-time-heres-a-challenge-for-you/\">how we use Druid for counting unique users in real-time</a>.</p>\n<p>If you happen to be based in Israel, you‚Äôre more than welcome to join our <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/The-Big-Web-Theory/\">R&#x26;D‚Äôs meetup group</a> and <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Big-Data-Israel/\">the Israeli chapter of Women in Big Data meetup group</a> (which is open to everyone, regardless of gender!).</p>\n<p>And last but not least, I invite you to connect via <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/itaiy/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ItaiYaffe\">Twitter</a> or follow me on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@itai.yaffe\">Medium</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.
