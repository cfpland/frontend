I really love when technology speakers draw parallels to events and characters outside of our industry, so his talk on leadership lessons learned through the underground railroad was right up my alley. Anjuan is a very clear and concise speaker who‚Äôs taken the stage internationally, so I‚Äôm very excited to bring his story to you here today. In this interview, Anjuan outlines some of the topics he‚Äôs passionate about and lessons he‚Äôs learned in his speaker‚Äôs journey.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HuvC1ME68I' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Anjuan Simmons at The Lead Dev Austin</em></p>\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CXHhfJH.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm an Engineering Coach at Help Scout, and my daily job is to make sure that the engineers on my team are successful and that we‚Äôre shipping features that our customers love.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking at a young age. I did one-act plays in high school, and I also competed in <a href=\"https://www.uiltexas.org/speech/oral-interp/2019-20-uil-poetry-categories\">UIL poetry interpretation</a>. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity‚Äôs ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like the feeling to contribution to the community. Sharing the knowledge I‚Äôve acquired over the years as a developer helps me improve my public speaking skills as well. Another thing that I love from conferences is networking and meeting new and amazingly interesting people from all over the world who share your interest and sometimes even hobbies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first talk. It was in the Vienna JS meetup, and I talked about a new library my team and I built at my current company. The idea was to share the library and promote it as open-source so anyone could use it. I was extremely nervous before going onto the stage, but the fact that my audience were developers too allowed me to relax a bit. At the end it went very well and smoothly. I got some very interesting questions after the talk and the people liked it.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJXzyHHh4pc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adri√°n Bolonio at ViennaJS</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to around 15 international conferences so far. In the last 2 years I‚Äôve been accepted to 4 conferences and several meetups.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKYA-7tczuk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adri√°n Bolonio on Accessibility at DevFest Vienna, 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>At the beginning I was nervous and my only routine was trying to calm down. Now I‚Äôm a bit more experienced, so I check that my computer has enough battery or I have a charger that works. I check that all my other applications are closed and my notifications are muted. I check that the microphone works properly and the screen where the presentation is shown is readable from any point in the venue.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think the best and more difficult advice is ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs ok to be a bit nervous, but try to understand that if you have been chosen to give a talk at a conference or at a local meetup it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre an expert in that field, so you know what you‚Äôre talking about. Just calm down, enjoy the talk, and accept any feedback.</p>\n<p>It needs to be fun for you, you don‚Äôt have to suffer, so please enjoy the process.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Since I‚Äôm very focused now on Web Accessibility I follow a lot of experts, but some of them are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo\">Manuel Matuzovic</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_sergeikriger\">Sergei Kriger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next speaker appearance in a conference will be at the <a href=\"https://jsconf.co/\">JSConf Colombia</a> on October 18th &#x26; 19th, 2019.
