One of the things I love about speaking at conferences is the\nopportunity to meet people from all over the world, so reading Geshan‚Äôs\nexperience as a speaker on multiple continents was inspiring.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*mQ216JZETiJBtVpHdGLBkA.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>Tell me about yourself? How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I have been a software engineer for more than a decade now. I have worked as a\nsoftware engineer in 3 countries in the past 10 years. I am primarily a backend\nsoftware engineer who dabbles in the frontend side of things once in a while.</p>\n<p>I used to do public speaking even in 2010 but I restarted doing it in 2014 when\nI spoke at a meetup in Kathmandu, Nepal. Then I started sending out abstract to\nCFPs in 2015, and in 2016 I spoke at my first conference: Code Motion Dubai.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like meeting like-minded people with the profession in common. All of us are\nsolution providers at the end of the day at times with code and sometimes\nwithout code too. I like the positive energy conferences have and regardless of\nwhere you work or the number of years of experience one has all of the\nparticipants are there to learn and share the experience. I admire the time,\neffort and resources put in by speakers for their talk.</p>\n<p>Public speaking, to be honest, has benefited my career both directly and\nindirectly. It has surely given me recognition and many people have approached\nme after doing some public speaking for various reasons. To be honest, adding a\nsection in your CV where you have spoken in a couple of good conferences does\nadd more value.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>My first big conference talk was in August, 2016 in Amsterdam for Laracon EU.\nProbably that was the biggest audience I had spoken in front of and included all\nthe who‚Äôs who of that community. It was a talk on ChatOps and I think for that\ncommunity of people it was a relatively new thing then.</p>\n<p><span class=\"figcaption_hack\">Geshan‚Äôs first big conference talk at Laracon EU, 2016</span></p>\n<p>I think it went pretty well, I was shaky and nervous when I started of course\nand then after the first 10 minutes I think I was in the flow and telling most\nof the things I had to talk about.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, I have lost count on how many CFPs I have submitted my abstracts,\nfrom 2015 it surely should be in the 100s. I generally submit to conferences\nthat cover both travel and accommodations or at least travel. Like an e-commerce\nwebsite, I believe (at least for me) the conversion (success) rate is like 1% or\nless :). In total from 2016 to now I have spoken at 4 conferences in 4\ncontinents, not sure if it qualifies me to be called an international speaker\nfrom Nepal though :).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I narrate the talk to myself the night before. Then right before the talk, I\nmake sure I have things I need with me like water, screen connections, and that\nthe screen size is fine. After I get on stage, I focus on delivering the message\nwith the right impact.</p>\n<p>I try to keep preparation pretty simple: don‚Äôt over-prepare, keep things\nspontaneous, but have some direction and keep an eye on the time.</p>\n<p>I usually don‚Äôt have speaker notes so I look at the slides and then improvise on\nthem. That‚Äôs why even if I do the same talk a second time, the details I include\neach time will be different.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For new speakers, there are two main pieces of advice:</p>\n<p><strong>First, give your talk on local meetups.</strong> Local user group meetups are always\nlooking for speakers so if you approach them you will rarely hear a no you can‚Äôt\npresent. Depending on your city, the frequency of meetups in your area of tech\nmight be many, little, or none. When you practice your talk in a smaller group\nyou get feedback and also get over imposter syndrome.</p>\n<p>Speaking is not a thing for everyone, so try it in a smaller group. If you like\nit do it more, but bare in mind public speaking is a very important skill for\nyour career.</p>\n<p><strong>The second one is to work on your title and abstract.</strong> When conferences have\nCFPs the main thing in my opinion that stands out is your title and abstract.\nThe relevance of the talk in that conference is vital too, for instance, a Ruby\nconference will never accept a PHP 7 features talk. As some conferences have\nblind speaker selection, always work an extra bit on your title and abstracts.</p>\n<p>Then, it‚Äôs all about submitting your talk to all the CFPs you can find. The best\nway to find CFPs is <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">confs.tech</a>,\nlanyrd.com (it‚Äôs usually down though),\n<a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">callingallpapers.com</a>.

Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One tech speaker who is great to listen to is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower\">Kelsey\nHightower</a> from Google.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Laurie and I‚Äôm a software engineer. I got into speaking for a couple of\nreasons. In my former life I was an active member of the debate team and did a\nlot of musical theatre, so audiences don‚Äôt scare me. I decided I wanted to be\ninvolved in technical speaking in part because I wanted to see more diversity\nrepresented on the stage.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*fM3yLcP58eVXUsdeHAnVdA.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>There is so much to love about speaking.</p>\n<p>I like thinking up the talk subject and coming up with something I think is new\nor interesting that will benefit attendees. While writing talks are a huge time\ncommitment, there is nothing quite like explaining a concept to others to help\ncrystalize it in your mind.</p>\n<p>And, speaking is an incredible way to connect with other people outside of your\ntech silo and/or geographic area. It has also opened up additional career\nopportunities for me, and has resulted in growing in different directions as\nwell, like writing blog posts and answering interview questions!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do! It was a local first year conference. I think the talk was meant to be 20\nminutes or so and I was overly concerned about running short.</p>\n<p>It went pretty well, and people laughed at my jokes, but I was far more nervous\nthan I‚Äôd expected to be. If you want to judge for yourself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS8tO3Z6E7U&#x26;t=579s\">the video is\nonline</a>.

I‚Äôve been accepted at 12 and spoken at 9‚Äì10 of those.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I try to arrive in the room as early as I can after the previous speaker, and\nnormally I run the talk through without notes while getting ready that morning.\nAs long as I know I have the cues in my head I‚Äôm not worried about any further\nmemorization.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>My biggest piece of advice is about content.</p>\n<p>The talks that are most engaging to me include stories of failure, they talk\nabout learning something you don‚Äôt know and falling down along the way, or\nthey‚Äôre a new perspective from an outsider on a specific topic.</p>\n<p>This isn‚Äôt a hard and fast rule, but I think it‚Äôs a great way to think about\npotential topics and to feel confident being honest with your audience.

Like many software developers, <strong>I felt that I didn‚Äôt really\nhave that much to talk about, that my experience was not unique, and that\nsomeone in the audience would call me out for being a fraud.</strong></p>\n<h3>Overcoming the Fear</h3>\n<p>Grappling with the fear of inadequacy is a lifelong pursuit for many of us. I‚Äôm\nfortunate to not be crippled by it, but it still took me years to put myself out\nthere and give a technical talk.</p>\n<p>The way I overcame this fear was to <strong>start small</strong>. As I came up with talk\nideas I pitched them to local meetups and code bootcamps. After giving some of\nthese talks, I realized that the audience isn‚Äôt as scary as I thought. <em>These\nare just other developers who genuinely want to learn something, and I‚Äôm lucky\nenough to be helping them!</em></p>\n<h3>Setting the Goal</h3>\n<p>Four conferences was arbitrary. It felt like enough that I would be able to call\nmyself a ‚Äúreal‚Äù conference speaker, but not so many that I would have to travel\nall the time. I love traveling, but with a wife and puppy at home, I have\npractical limits.</p>\n<p>So, I settled on four, and started forming a plan for making it happen.</p>\n<h3>Making a Plan</h3>\n<p>When I create a personal goal, I don‚Äôt just write it down and check on it. The\nimportant part to goal-setting is making measurable milestones that you believe\nwill help you achieve that goal. In this case, I started by making a sub-goal:</p>\n<h4>Sub-Goal: Get Accepted to Speak at One Conference</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>‚úÖ Write 2 conference talk proposals</li>\n<li>‚úÖ Create slides for the proposed talks</li>\n<li>‚úÖ Find 40+ conference CFPs</li>\n<li>‚úÖ Submit 2 proposals to 3+ conferences per week until I get accepted</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I worked my way through the checklist (it probably took about 12 weeks in\nall), I learned a lot about how to write a good proposal and what conferences\nusually looked for. I was very careful to read the conference‚Äôs CFP page, but\nI‚Äôll admit that I sometimes submitted proposals that weren‚Äôt an ideal fit\nanyway.</p>\n<p>Within a few weeks, <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/api-strat-2017-presentation\">I had gotten my first\nacceptance</a>! Now\nI knew what it would take to get a talk accepted, and I felt like I had some\nmomentum.</p>\n<h3>Oh Yeah, I Still Have to Prepare</h3>\n<p>With one conference booked, I started refining and practicing my proposed talk.\nThe very first time I went through the slides it took me 25 minutes‚Ä¶for a 45\nminute speaking slot‚Ä¶whoops!</p>\n<p>This is where the meetups came in. After I had practiced about 12 times on my\nown, I gave my talk to the local <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers-js-chicago\">Chicago Javascript\nmeetup</a>. I\npracticed solo several more times before giving it at the conference.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Va0ug0QDjguymVqLGXvU-g.png\" class=\"center\">\n<p>But while I was preparing, I was surprised to see acceptances continue rolling\nin. I ended up getting 7 accepts in the first few months of pitching my talk.</p>\n<h3>It Doesn‚Äôt Always Work Out</h3>\n<p>I was excited, but started to run into some tough decisions. One conference in\nRomania was the same weekend as a family obligation and two conferences were on\nthe exact same day, so I turned down the second one that accepted me. In another\nunexpected turn, one conference couldn‚Äôt get the attendance they needed, so it\nwas cancelled outright.</p>\n<p>That took my total for 2017/2018 down to four. A manageable number, and even\nbetter, I had hit my goal for the year! üéâ</p>\n<h3>The takeaway: CFPs seem hard, but they don‚Äôt have to be</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary\">I learned a lot in that first year\nspeaking</a>, and\nwhile I‚Äôve dialed back the number of applications I submit, I‚Äôm still actively\nengaged in the speaking community, and submitting a few CFPs per month.</p>\n<p>The whole experience has showed me that speaking isn‚Äôt as scary as it seems, and\nsubmitting winning CFPs isn‚Äôt a black art. It inspired me to create something\nthat would help other speakers ‚Äî new and experienced ‚Äî improve their odds of\nsuccess and become better, more prolific speakers, and thus <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land was\nborn</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IANh995.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>CFP Land: Never Miss a Call for Proposals Again</h3>\n<p><strong>One of the most frustrating things for me was when I‚Äôd discover a great\nconference in a fantastic location just a few days or weeks too late.</strong> Once the\nCFP closes, you have to wait a whole year to get back in the mix, and keeping up\nwith dozens of conferences is a lot of work.</p>\n<p>Initially, I used <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr\">Airtable</a> to store\nall the conferences I could find. Each week, I‚Äôd manually check on them and\nupdate CFP dates and links as needed. It took valuable time away from the real\nwork of writing proposals and practicing my talk, so I thought this problem\nneeded a better solution.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, other conference aggregators and CFP websites already exist, but\nthe killer feature that they were missing was a single weekly reminder of all\nupcoming CFPs.</p>\n<p>This seems obvious, but I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of it if I hadn‚Äôt spent months\napplying for CFPs. <strong>As a speaker, I don‚Äôt want a huge list of conferences or a\nbunch of noise ‚Äî I just want a focused, weekly reminder of all the CFPs that\nwould be right for me.</strong></p>\n<h3>The Present and the Future</h3>\n<p>In its current iteration, <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a> is an email\nnewsletter with all the upcoming CFPs listed in chronological order. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfp_land\">I also\nTweet each CFP</a> when it‚Äôs due in 30 days so\nfollowers have plenty of time to submit.</p>\n<p>As speakers have joined, I‚Äôve gotten some great feedback, and am working on\nimprovements already. In the coming months, you‚Äôll be able to filter CFPs by\nlocation, category, and whether or not travel/hotel costs are covered. I‚Äôm also\nworking to get more data from more sources so speakers are really sure to never\nmiss a CFP again.</p>\n<p>Of course, I can‚Äôt continue improving CFP Land without input from other\nspeakers!
