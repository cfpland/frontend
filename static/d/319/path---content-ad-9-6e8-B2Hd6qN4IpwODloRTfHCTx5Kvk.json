After gathering feedback from hundreds of technology conference speakers, I realized that like me, many of them struggled to find and keep up with which CFPs were available and which ones they had applied to. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to make sure CFP Land was self-sustaining, so CFP Land Pro was born.</p>\n<p>If you’re considering a <a href=\"/members/\">Pro Membership</a>, read on to learn more about everything that’s included. Don’t hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:info@cfpland.com\">email me</a> if you have questions about how CFP Land can help you be a more successful speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2><span id=\"early-access\">1. Early Access to CFPs</span></h2>\n<p>The weekly CFP Land newsletter and <a href=\"/conferences/\">our free conference listings</a> show all CFPs that close in the next 21 days. Usually this is plenty of time to apply, but many conferences review applicants on a rolling basis. In those cases, <strong>applying as early as possible is advantageous</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular features among Pro Members is the early access to CFPs. If you’re not a Pro Member already, you won’t see any conferences tagged <code class=\"language-text\">⬆️ Pro</code> in your feed, but if you sign up for a Pro Membership, here’s what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png\" alt=\"Pro Members get access to CFPs 21 days before free members\"></a></p>\n<p>As a Pro Member, you can see all the CFPs in our database that are closing in the next <strong>42 days</strong>, meaning you’ll be able to apply much earlier than free users.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"save-cfps\">2. Save CFPs</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/save-cfps-1.gif\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Save conferences to be reminded before they close\"></a></p>\n<p>It’s easy to lose track of which CFPs you want to submit when there are hundreds each month on CFP Land alone. <strong>Saving CFPs is a great way to keep up with the conferences that you care about most.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you save a CFP to your Pro account, you’ll get email reminders 21, 7, and 3 days before it closes. This is great if you’re browsing CFPs on mobile, but you don’t want to forget to submit to them when you’re back at your computer.</p>\n<p>Another useful reason to save CFPs is to personalize your feed of upcoming Calls for Proposals. By default, there may be 50 to 100 open CFPs on the “All” page, so saving CFPs will ensure you don’t have to wade through quite as many irrelevant conferences.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"export-cfps\">3. Export CFPs to Your Personal Calendar</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/export-cfps-2.gif\" alt=\"Using CFP Land Pro to export conferences to your calendar\"></a></p>\n<p>You don’t have to track your CFPs in CFP Land. Pro Members also get a calendar export tool that allows you to save CFPs to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook.</p>\n<p>This is helpful if you want to create custom reminders or use your own calendar notifications rather than the CFP Land emails.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"search-alerts\">4. Custom Search Alerts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-2.gif\" alt=\"Saving searches with your CFP Land Pro Membership\"></a></p>\n<p>All CFP Land users can use filters to search for conferences that match their preferences, but if you’re a free user, you will need to check the site periodically to make sure you don’t miss any new opportunities. In order to make your life a little easier, <strong>CFP Land Pro Members can save their searches to get an email alert when new CFPs are found that match their filters.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-3.png\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Email alert when results from a saved search are found\" /></a></p>\n<p>When a new conference CFP is found that matches one of your saved searches, you’ll get an email about it, letting you know that you can either <a href=\"/blog/pro-saving-cfps/\">Save the CFP</a> or apply right away.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you’ll never miss another great CFP once you set up your searches on <a href=\"/members/\">CFP Land Pro</a>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"abstracts\">5. Save Your Abstracts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/abstracts.png\" alt=\"Abstracts on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Most experienced speakers have a pool of abstracts that they could submit depending on the audience and conference focus. CFP Land Pro Members can save those Abstracts to their CFP Land account so that they can tie them to each CFP they submit.</p>\n<p>This is a great way to see which of your abstracts is the most successful and to remember which Abstract you submitted to which conference.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"track\">6. Track Your Submissions</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/track.gif\" alt=\"Track submissions on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Finally, if you submit dozens of Abstracts per year, it can be hard to keep up with all of them. In my first year of speaking, I used a giant spreadsheet to track over 50 submissions, and it got to be a huge mess.</p>\n<p>CFP Land Pro Members can track the conferences they’ve applied to, been accepted at, and been rejected from in addition to attaching their Abstracts to each submission.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Much more will be coming soon, so if you’re interested, <a href=\"/members/\">your CFP Land Pro Membership is just a few clicks away</a>!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Pro Members Only: A Complete List of All the Features CFP Land Pro Members Get","path":"/blog/pro-features/","category":"Updates","tags":["Pro Features"],"date":"2020/02/07","image":"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Last year, I heard about a new conference called <a href=\"https://www.developer-first.com/conference\">Developer First</a> specifically for technology\nleaders.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cuCV5BH66UNiamgKS4EyAPZgD8Vpiro-\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am currently a Senior Engineering Manager at Target Corp in Minneapolis, MN. I lead a team of amazing Engineers who build tools for our global supply chain users. Outside of my day job, I founded a company called Developer First to help organizations around the world build strong Engineering teams which I believe starts with developing confident, purposeful and inspiring leaders.</p>\n<p>I was absolutely terrified of public speaking throughout college and into the first couple years of my professional career. I avoided it at all costs and was a terrible speaker in front of an audience of any size. I eventually realized that I couldn’t continue avoiding public speaking and joined my organization’s Toastmaster’s club. I was thrilled to discover a safe and comfortable environment to practice my new skills and overcome my fears. I spent a couple years as a practicing member before being elected President of my local chapter.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is not a requirement of my role, but I enjoy the opportunity to connect with leaders outside of my organization and feel like I am inspiring and influencing others to reflect and potentially shift their mindsets on technical leadership.</p>\n<p><strong>My favorite experiences of speaking at conferences are the conversations I have with folks who approach me after my talk.</strong> It is very rewarding to hear how my ideas resonated with them and even more enjoyable when they share new ideas that I hadn’t thought of!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I speak about a variety of topics related to the unique challenges of being an engineering leader: people first leadership, time management, prioritization, effective communication, coaching developers, diversity &#x26; inclusion, effective on boarding programs, etc.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was part of an executive track at an engineering conference in NYC. I talked so fast that I finished my 45 minute talk in 20 minutes. I remember arriving to the speaker staging room 90 minutes early because I was so nervous that I would be late or not find the location. My confidence and skills were definitely lacking. However, I don’t regret any of it! I was passionate about the topic and strongly believe that you have to start somewhere. No video footage exists (thank goodness).</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied: hundreds</p>\n<p>Spoken at: ~25</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ut7jEkIf1ac' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>”<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7jEkIf1ac\">Developer First Leadership</a>” by Kate Wardin at React Boston</em></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I usually run through the slides about an hour before my talk. <strong>The more familiar the ideas are, the more comfortable I am.</strong> After that, I try to relax and maybe go introduce myself to other attendees during the break before my talk.</p>\n<p>Another tip: make sure you check what type of projector or input is needed before you arrive to speak!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DON’T WAIT. START WITH ANYTHING.</strong> Submit topics that you feel even somewhat confident to present on, and then invest the time to fully research, compile content, and practice(!!). It is amazing how your idea will flourish and grow the longer you have to reflect on the topic, gather feedback, and learn through other experiences. You just need to start with something - anything that you are passionate about. If you have an idea swirling in your head for longer than a couple weeks, take some time to start drafting an abstract and outline.</li>\n<li>Make sure you propose a topic that you are passionate about. There is nothing worse than a dull speaker who isn’t personally energized by the topic.</li>\n<li>READING THE ROOM: <strong>Nothing kills confidence faster than making eye contact with members of the audience who seem skeptical or not engaged.</strong> I like to find the person (or people) that actively shows feedback (nods, smiles) and focus my attention on them throughout my talk. As for those skeptics, I have found that it is dangerous to interpret the non-verbals of humans that you don’t personally know. In fact, on several occasions, some of those “skeptics” (or so I thought) approached me after my talk and expressed gratitude and shared that they loved my topic.</li>\n<li>Join a frequent flyer/hotel chain rewards program. Admittedly, I also got into conference speaking because I wanted an excuse to travel more and rack up those airline/hotel points. Check and check.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.developer-first.com/\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-wardin/\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/developer_first\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upcoming talks: NoFluffJustStuff US tour, StretchCon Budapest, &#x26; Developer First Tech Leadership Conference</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

There’s something unifying about knowing that technologists from every corner of the globe can meet together to offer their tips and thoughts to others, and Vincenzo mentioned a similar appreciation in his interview here. As a speaker, he’s gotten to travel across the world to give talks on a variety of topics. Vincenzo’s approach to coming up with new talk ideas is also really interesting.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/G2DRaCN.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Vincenzo Chianese, I am an Italian Software Developer that’s been working for the last 5 years in the WebAPIs space, providing tools for API Developers. I mostly code in TypeScript/JavaScript these days, but previously I’ve worked with C#, C++ and VB6. I am an Auth0 Ambassador and a Google Developer Expert in WebTechnologies and I’ve been living in Prague, Madrid and (starting in January) in Austin, TX.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The ability to travel and see new places. I think I’ve been able to go on all the continents just because of the speaking engagements I had, which would have been impossible otherwise.</p>\n<p>Second? Networking with speakers; <strong>I met some of my best contacts I have in the space because of the conferences,</strong> and I even ended up organising a conference because of some people I met in Paris last year. You never know who you’re talking to — and you can be surprised. Curiously enough, the content is really the last reason I’d go to a conference.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I have always refused to present basic-level stuff that you can easily find on the web (tutorials and documentation) or even worse marked products for the company I work for. <strong>So every 8-10 months I do kind of a retrospective of what I’ve been working on and if I see a fit for an interesting talk (such as something that you don’t exactly do everyday, something that has never been treated elsewhere)</strong> — I put up an abstract and a title and try to submit it around.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the topic is appreciated, but most of the times it is not. My point is — I want to share experiences, not technical documents in an oral form.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I totally remember it. It was in 2015 at the mDevCamp and I was asked to replace a colleague that couldn’t make it. I was in an horrible condition (I had fever) and it was at the very last moment. I didn’t want to leave the company unrepresented to I took the bet and had the presentation anyway.</p>\n<p>I must say, my English has improved since then, I promise.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYvsept0oio' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>”<a href=\"https://slideslive.com/38894088/building-resilient-api-client\">Building resilient API client</a>” by Vincenzo Chianese at mDevCamp</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>In general, I apply to everything that makes sense, no matter the location or the timing of the year; that’s something I prefer to figure out later. Although I had a lot of speaking engagements, I still get rejected by default by most of the events. Some conference organisers that I met personally saw that I usually bring solid topics and so they were kind enough to invite me back. Anyway, I think my ratio is 1/5 (every 5 submissions, one goes through and gets accepted). You can do the math.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I found myself in the world of the conferences accidentally and I had basically no training. Here are some things I wish I would have done before doing this serially and seriously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find a local Meetup in your native language. You need to get confident in front of the crowd and the meet-ups are perfect: low expectations, willingness to listen from the audience and the “even-if-everything-fails-nothing-happens” guarantee that will make you feel comfortable. Rinse and repeat 2-3 times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find a meetup in English, and try the same talk. You will probably have to pay for your own flight (although a lot of meetups in Europe give talks in English anyway), but it’s an investment, so totally worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time to apply to a conference.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’ve also wrote a small essay on what to keep in mind when sending a CFP to a conference, <a href=\"https://dev.to/vncz/a-reviewer-s-perspective-on-getting-your-conference-proposal-accepted-1e6p\">sharing some thoughts as an organiser</a>.

It’s a lot like the interviews I do here on CFP Land!</p>\n<p>So, I’m very excited to bring you Tanay’s speaker story today. His experience moving from casual speaker, to professional Developer Advocate is a great example of how speaking at tech conferences can truly change the course of your career. He was also kind enough to include a link to his first conference talk ever so you can see how far he’s come.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rNiq6xr.png?1\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://crate.io/\">Crate.io</a> which means I am working closely with the community of engineers using CrateDB. I am speaking at a lot at conferences, holding webinars, writing tutorials and articles. I got into public speaking after joining a program called <a href=\"https://events.mozilla.org/techspeakers\">Mozilla Tech Speakers</a>. I gave my first talk in 2016 in Russia.</p>\n<p>I have been going to conferences for a while now and I have met some truly amazing speakers from whom I have learnt a lot. I thought, why not record our conversations and make them available as a podcast so that a lot more people can benefit from it? This is a side project that is very dear to me on which I am concentrating on these days. It is called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">Technically True</a> and I chat with inspiring people in the industry to gain insights on topics related to public speaking and developer relations.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Initially, one of the strongest incentives was travelling to new places. Over time, the thing I liked the most about this was meeting new developer communities, engaging with them and of course, speaking and sharing what I have been working on.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences helped me gain more exposure and until the end of 2018, it was something that I did just for fun. Then I realised that I used up almost all of my vacation days for speaking at conferences and that now maybe it is time that I should do this full-time. That is when I decided to quit my job and join Crate.io this year as a full-time Developer Advocate. It’s been almost a year that speaking has been a part of my daily work and I’m lovin’ it!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>These days, I have been speaking a lot about databases, industry 4.0, machine and time-series data. I especially enjoy talking about case-studies related to IoT that we do with our clients. I also speak on WebXR with A-Frame and building multiplayer games with that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Sure, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was very thrilled about it but got very nervous the day before I had to give the talk. I experienced a cocktail of feelings like impostor syndrome, adrenaline rush and anxiety. Once I started speaking, I realised that I was really enjoying it and all the fear melted away. The talk went well, I had a lot of questions and the feedback was good. I watched the recorded video later on and identified a lot of things that I had to fix like filler words and so on. It’s not easy to watch a video of your talk but trust me, it can be the best way to improve your speaking skills. I even have a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZTJOhz6INQ\">my first talk on YouTube</a>, it helps me realize how far I have come and how far I still have to go.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZTJOhz6INQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>“Getting Started With Web Based Virtual Reality” by Tanay Pant (his first conference talk)</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied to? Hundreds! Spoken at? I think it is probably close to twenty-five.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that is the most important for me is putting my Slack, laptop and mobile on do not disturb. I always take off my watch before going on the stage - loose watches can create a distraction for both the speakers and the audience by going up and down the wrist. Smartwatches on the other hand can light up with hand movements. I use an app called HiddenMe for hiding all the icons, files and folders from my Desktop, especially if I have to give a demo and need to exit Powerpoint. I think that it’s important to have a bottle of water on the stage especially for longer talks.</p>\n<p>I recently talked about pre-talk rituals with Niels Leenheer and you can hear stories from us about the things we do and why we do them <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">in the episode coming out on December 1</a>.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Well, there’s SO many things. Let’s go through a speaker’s journey from picking a topic to chatting with the audience at the end of the talk.</p>\n<p>First of all, topic selection. It’s most important to choose something really interesting to you, something that you are passionate about. That plays a huge factor in how much confidence and enthusiasm you have when you are up on the stage. If you’d like to know more about CFPs and how conferences select talks, I can highly recommend following <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/talk-selection-in-conferences-with-kristina-schneider\">Kristina Schneider’s advice</a> on the topic (she organises CSSConfEU).</p>\n<p>Once your talk is ready, make sure to practice it well but also beware of over-rehearsing. Practising your talk a couple of times helps you to further tailor your talks and make them leaner. It also helps you with your confidence on stage in case something goes sideways.</p>\n<p>If something doesn’t go exactly as you wanted to on the stage or if the demo fails, make a joke about it and move on. Make sure that you have a video that you can show in its place. Don’t let it affect the rest of your talk and your morale. Things go wrong, it’s okay. This happens to everybody.</p>\n<p>Make sure you stick around after you talk to answer the questions from the audience and help them in any way you can. <strong>Never forget that the audience is the most important group in that room and always be humble.</strong> I can go on about this topic for hours, if you have more questions DO reach out to me.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One of the talks that have inspired me the most was given by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mio_Loclair\">Christian Mio Loclair</a> in Berlin about <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/273373088\">Narciss</a> back in 2018. Having said that, there are a countless number of people who have inspired me and I usually end up inviting them to my podcast. 😅</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am most active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanay1337\">Twitter</a> but I can also be found on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337\">LinkedIn</a>.

While many tech conference speakers do it for their own personal development, some are specifically hired to speak, travel, and be a face for the community. That’s what Nicolas does now, but like all speakers, it’s taken a journey to get there. In today’s Speaker Story, we hear how Nicolas got started as well as some of his tips for new conference speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m Nicolas Fränkel, a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a>. My main job is to speak at conferences, so that people know about Hazelcast the In-Memory-Data-Grid and <a href=\"https://jet.hazelcast.org/\">Jet</a>. I’m also the point of contact for the community.</p>\n<p>I’ve been a teacher for more than 20 years, given that the best way to learn is to teach. However, some subjects are not relevant in academia. I discovered the <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/\">Vaadin web framework</a>, and I was so enthralled by it that I wanted to show it to the members of my local Java User Group. That was 7 years ago.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EOLCiAD.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects! For example, last summer, I was feeling a bit down with so much travelling around. I arrived at my hotel just a couple of hours before a talk. I wasn’t happy to be there, but I went to give the talk. After that, I felt really better, all bad feelings had been washed away.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I started public speaking at my Java user group one evening. Soon afterwards, when I travelled for work, I started to propose local user groups to host my talk. Then, I took vacations to speak at international conferences. I did more and more of them. <strong>But at one point, I realized that was pretty dumb to be paid to do a dull job (consulting on development/architecture) while taking vacations to do something that I really liked.</strong> One year ago, I steered my career toward Developer Advocacy, which includes a large part of public speaking.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I’m a tech guy, so in general I stick to technical subjects. They include Java - it has been my bread and butter for years, Kotlin, Spring and Spring Boot, DevOps, Kubernetes and of course, Hazelcast IMDG and Jet.</p>\n<p>I once did a motivational talk, but it was quite hard for me. I might do more organizational/management-related talks in the future, as I already wrote some related blog posts already. But it means going far out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first talk at my local user group very vividly.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I was used to teach, but to talk in front of your peers is very different. <strong>When teaching, you speak from a position of power; when speaking in front of your peers, they will judge you - in a good or a bad way, and it will have a lasting effect.</strong> For this reason, I had asked some good friends to come, and they did. The room was overflowing with people, with some sitting on the stairs. I was very nervous before the talk, and in the first few minutes. Then, just like when coding, I focused on the subject at hand and went “into the zone”. I don’t remember the specifics afterwards, it was just “business as usual”.</p>\n<p>I believe the talk went pretty well, as I remember people clapping, and thus it was a great experience that helped me apply to speak again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don’t keep the count of the number of conferences I’ve submitted to, but to give you a rough idea, this year, I’ll speak at a total of 68 conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don’t have routine per se, but I like to be at my place and prepared far in advance (at least 20 minutes). Being early was useful for a conference at the earlier this year, when I noticed very early that the projector didn’t work, and I had to run to find someone to help me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Wow, answering this question could easily fill a book!</p>\n<p>Regarding impostor syndrome, the main advice would be the following: I often hear great and skilled people not submitting talks because they’re afraid they have nothing new to say. Well, if that would be the case, not many people would do public speaking. I believe on the opposite that <strong>most people have a unique experience and bring a unique viewpoint, even to subjects that have been spoken about a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>For finding conferences, I use <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a> and <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">sessionize.com</a>. They also allow to write your bio and abstract once, find your conferences, and then submit them at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>For the rest, I already wrote a post named <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Advices for junior conference speakers</a> that might be of interest. Expect more to come in the future.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I became exposed to the world of Developer Advocacy through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaruch\">Baruch Sadogursky</a>. He was the one that made me understand by his behavior that public speaking could be a job - or at least a part thereof.</p>\n<p>For the sheer number of talks, I need to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbuxman\">Josh Long</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. As the latter told when he introduced himself during a panel is: “I’m Venkat, I live in a plane”. And then he passed the mic.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/\">blog where I publish a weekly post</a>. This is also where you can find <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/speaking/\">my list of talks</a>, present and future. For videos, I keep a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0EuBuKK-s1EL-K3okpYwR0QZbAPRVmEG\">list on Youtube</a>.
