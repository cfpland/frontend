However, it also means that there may be people in the audience who don’t care about your talk. With a multi-track conference, the people who do attend your talk will be more interested in what you have to say. But this also brings anxiety or disappointment when not as many people choose your talk as you’d like, and you have to give your talk to an awkwardly small crowd.” - <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0</a></li>\n<li>Company-run vs. community</li>\n<li>Annual or more frequent</li>\n<li>Virtual or in-person</li>\n<li>Profit or not-for-profit?</li>\n<li>“Some conferences are for-profit. Others make little to no money for the organizers, and are largely a labor of love for the community. Some for-profit conferences will masquerade as the latter. Make sure you know what the conference is and if you’re comfortable with it before you accept.” - <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Economics: Speakers, sponsors, and attendees</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://2019.jsconf.eu/news/the-jsconf-cssconf-eu-finances/\">https://2019.jsconf.eu/news/the-jsconf-cssconf-eu-finances/</a></li>\n<li>Sponsors and attendees generally pay</li>\n<li>Speakers rarely paid, but usually get free ticket.
