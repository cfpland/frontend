There‚Äôs something unifying about knowing that technologists from every corner of the globe can meet together to offer their tips and thoughts to others, and Vincenzo mentioned a similar appreciation in his interview here. As a speaker, he‚Äôs gotten to travel across the world to give talks on a variety of topics. Vincenzo‚Äôs approach to coming up with new talk ideas is also really interesting.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/G2DRaCN.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Vincenzo Chianese, I am an Italian Software Developer that‚Äôs been working for the last 5 years in the WebAPIs space, providing tools for API Developers. I mostly code in TypeScript/JavaScript these days, but previously I‚Äôve worked with C#, C++ and VB6. I am an Auth0 Ambassador and a Google Developer Expert in WebTechnologies and I‚Äôve been living in Prague, Madrid and (starting in January) in Austin, TX.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The ability to travel and see new places. I think I‚Äôve been able to go on all the continents just because of the speaking engagements I had, which would have been impossible otherwise.</p>\n<p>Second? Networking with speakers; <strong>I met some of my best contacts I have in the space because of the conferences,</strong> and I even ended up organising a conference because of some people I met in Paris last year. You never know who you‚Äôre talking to ‚Äî and you can be surprised. Curiously enough, the content is really the last reason I‚Äôd go to a conference.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I have always refused to present basic-level stuff that you can easily find on the web (tutorials and documentation) or even worse marked products for the company I work for. <strong>So every 8-10 months I do kind of a retrospective of what I‚Äôve been working on and if I see a fit for an interesting talk (such as something that you don‚Äôt exactly do everyday, something that has never been treated elsewhere)</strong> ‚Äî I put up an abstract and a title and try to submit it around.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the topic is appreciated, but most of the times it is not. My point is ‚Äî I want to share experiences, not technical documents in an oral form.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I totally remember it. It was in 2015 at the mDevCamp and I was asked to replace a colleague that couldn‚Äôt make it. I was in an horrible condition (I had fever) and it was at the very last moment. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the company unrepresented to I took the bet and had the presentation anyway.</p>\n<p>I must say, my English has improved since then, I promise.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYvsept0oio' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://slideslive.com/38894088/building-resilient-api-client\">Building resilient API client</a>‚Äù by Vincenzo Chianese at mDevCamp</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>In general, I apply to everything that makes sense, no matter the location or the timing of the year; that‚Äôs something I prefer to figure out later. Although I had a lot of speaking engagements, I still get rejected by default by most of the events. Some conference organisers that I met personally saw that I usually bring solid topics and so they were kind enough to invite me back. Anyway, I think my ratio is 1/5 (every 5 submissions, one goes through and gets accepted). You can do the math.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I found myself in the world of the conferences accidentally and I had basically no training. Here are some things I wish I would have done before doing this serially and seriously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find a local Meetup in your native language. You need to get confident in front of the crowd and the meet-ups are perfect: low expectations, willingness to listen from the audience and the ‚Äúeven-if-everything-fails-nothing-happens‚Äù guarantee that will make you feel comfortable. Rinse and repeat 2-3 times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find a meetup in English, and try the same talk. You will probably have to pay for your own flight (although a lot of meetups in Europe give talks in English anyway), but it‚Äôs an investment, so totally worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time to apply to a conference.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I‚Äôve also wrote a small essay on what to keep in mind when sending a CFP to a conference, <a href=\"https://dev.to/vncz/a-reviewer-s-perspective-on-getting-your-conference-proposal-accepted-1e6p\">sharing some thoughts as an organiser</a>.

Every episode, he interviews someone working in Developer Relations or who speaks or organizes conferences to learn from them and help pass on their knowledge. It‚Äôs a lot like the interviews I do here on CFP Land!</p>\n<p>So, I‚Äôm very excited to bring you Tanay‚Äôs speaker story today. His experience moving from casual speaker, to professional Developer Advocate is a great example of how speaking at tech conferences can truly change the course of your career. He was also kind enough to include a link to his first conference talk ever so you can see how far he‚Äôs come.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rNiq6xr.png?1\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://crate.io/\">Crate.io</a> which means I am working closely with the community of engineers using CrateDB. I am speaking at a lot at conferences, holding webinars, writing tutorials and articles. I got into public speaking after joining a program called <a href=\"https://events.mozilla.org/techspeakers\">Mozilla Tech Speakers</a>. I gave my first talk in 2016 in Russia.</p>\n<p>I have been going to conferences for a while now and I have met some truly amazing speakers from whom I have learnt a lot. I thought, why not record our conversations and make them available as a podcast so that a lot more people can benefit from it? This is a side project that is very dear to me on which I am concentrating on these days. It is called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">Technically True</a> and I chat with inspiring people in the industry to gain insights on topics related to public speaking and developer relations.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Initially, one of the strongest incentives was travelling to new places. Over time, the thing I liked the most about this was meeting new developer communities, engaging with them and of course, speaking and sharing what I have been working on.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences helped me gain more exposure and until the end of 2018, it was something that I did just for fun. Then I realised that I used up almost all of my vacation days for speaking at conferences and that now maybe it is time that I should do this full-time. That is when I decided to quit my job and join Crate.io this year as a full-time Developer Advocate. It‚Äôs been almost a year that speaking has been a part of my daily work and I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>These days, I have been speaking a lot about databases, industry 4.0, machine and time-series data. I especially enjoy talking about case-studies related to IoT that we do with our clients. I also speak on WebXR with A-Frame and building multiplayer games with that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Sure, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was very thrilled about it but got very nervous the day before I had to give the talk. I experienced a cocktail of feelings like impostor syndrome, adrenaline rush and anxiety. Once I started speaking, I realised that I was really enjoying it and all the fear melted away. The talk went well, I had a lot of questions and the feedback was good. I watched the recorded video later on and identified a lot of things that I had to fix like filler words and so on. It‚Äôs not easy to watch a video of your talk but trust me, it can be the best way to improve your speaking skills. I even have a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZTJOhz6INQ\">my first talk on YouTube</a>, it helps me realize how far I have come and how far I still have to go.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZTJOhz6INQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúGetting Started With Web Based Virtual Reality‚Äù by Tanay Pant (his first conference talk)</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied to? Hundreds! Spoken at? I think it is probably close to twenty-five.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that is the most important for me is putting my Slack, laptop and mobile on do not disturb. I always take off my watch before going on the stage - loose watches can create a distraction for both the speakers and the audience by going up and down the wrist. Smartwatches on the other hand can light up with hand movements. I use an app called HiddenMe for hiding all the icons, files and folders from my Desktop, especially if I have to give a demo and need to exit Powerpoint. I think that it‚Äôs important to have a bottle of water on the stage especially for longer talks.</p>\n<p>I recently talked about pre-talk rituals with Niels Leenheer and you can hear stories from us about the things we do and why we do them <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">in the episode coming out on December 1</a>.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Well, there‚Äôs SO many things. Let‚Äôs go through a speaker‚Äôs journey from picking a topic to chatting with the audience at the end of the talk.</p>\n<p>First of all, topic selection. It‚Äôs most important to choose something really interesting to you, something that you are passionate about. That plays a huge factor in how much confidence and enthusiasm you have when you are up on the stage. If you‚Äôd like to know more about CFPs and how conferences select talks, I can highly recommend following <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/talk-selection-in-conferences-with-kristina-schneider\">Kristina Schneider‚Äôs advice</a> on the topic (she organises CSSConfEU).</p>\n<p>Once your talk is ready, make sure to practice it well but also beware of over-rehearsing. Practising your talk a couple of times helps you to further tailor your talks and make them leaner. It also helps you with your confidence on stage in case something goes sideways.</p>\n<p>If something doesn‚Äôt go exactly as you wanted to on the stage or if the demo fails, make a joke about it and move on. Make sure that you have a video that you can show in its place. Don‚Äôt let it affect the rest of your talk and your morale. Things go wrong, it‚Äôs okay. This happens to everybody.</p>\n<p>Make sure you stick around after you talk to answer the questions from the audience and help them in any way you can. <strong>Never forget that the audience is the most important group in that room and always be humble.</strong> I can go on about this topic for hours, if you have more questions DO reach out to me.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One of the talks that have inspired me the most was given by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mio_Loclair\">Christian Mio Loclair</a> in Berlin about <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/273373088\">Narciss</a> back in 2018. Having said that, there are a countless number of people who have inspired me and I usually end up inviting them to my podcast. üòÖ</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am most active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanay1337\">Twitter</a> but I can also be found on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337\">LinkedIn</a>.

While many tech conference speakers do it for their own personal development, some are specifically hired to speak, travel, and be a face for the community. That‚Äôs what Nicolas does now, but like all speakers, it‚Äôs taken a journey to get there. In today‚Äôs Speaker Story, we hear how Nicolas got started as well as some of his tips for new conference speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Nicolas Fr√§nkel, a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a>. My main job is to speak at conferences, so that people know about Hazelcast the In-Memory-Data-Grid and <a href=\"https://jet.hazelcast.org/\">Jet</a>. I‚Äôm also the point of contact for the community.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been a teacher for more than 20 years, given that the best way to learn is to teach. However, some subjects are not relevant in academia. I discovered the <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/\">Vaadin web framework</a>, and I was so enthralled by it that I wanted to show it to the members of my local Java User Group. That was 7 years ago.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EOLCiAD.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects! For example, last summer, I was feeling a bit down with so much travelling around. I arrived at my hotel just a couple of hours before a talk. I wasn‚Äôt happy to be there, but I went to give the talk. After that, I felt really better, all bad feelings had been washed away.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I started public speaking at my Java user group one evening. Soon afterwards, when I travelled for work, I started to propose local user groups to host my talk. Then, I took vacations to speak at international conferences. I did more and more of them. <strong>But at one point, I realized that was pretty dumb to be paid to do a dull job (consulting on development/architecture) while taking vacations to do something that I really liked.</strong> One year ago, I steered my career toward Developer Advocacy, which includes a large part of public speaking.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a tech guy, so in general I stick to technical subjects. They include Java - it has been my bread and butter for years, Kotlin, Spring and Spring Boot, DevOps, Kubernetes and of course, Hazelcast IMDG and Jet.</p>\n<p>I once did a motivational talk, but it was quite hard for me. I might do more organizational/management-related talks in the future, as I already wrote some related blog posts already. But it means going far out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first talk at my local user group very vividly.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I was used to teach, but to talk in front of your peers is very different. <strong>When teaching, you speak from a position of power; when speaking in front of your peers, they will judge you - in a good or a bad way, and it will have a lasting effect.</strong> For this reason, I had asked some good friends to come, and they did. The room was overflowing with people, with some sitting on the stairs. I was very nervous before the talk, and in the first few minutes. Then, just like when coding, I focused on the subject at hand and went ‚Äúinto the zone‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember the specifics afterwards, it was just ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I believe the talk went pretty well, as I remember people clapping, and thus it was a great experience that helped me apply to speak again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt keep the count of the number of conferences I‚Äôve submitted to, but to give you a rough idea, this year, I‚Äôll speak at a total of 68 conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have routine per se, but I like to be at my place and prepared far in advance (at least 20 minutes). Being early was useful for a conference at the earlier this year, when I noticed very early that the projector didn‚Äôt work, and I had to run to find someone to help me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Wow, answering this question could easily fill a book!</p>\n<p>Regarding impostor syndrome, the main advice would be the following: I often hear great and skilled people not submitting talks because they‚Äôre afraid they have nothing new to say. Well, if that would be the case, not many people would do public speaking. I believe on the opposite that <strong>most people have a unique experience and bring a unique viewpoint, even to subjects that have been spoken about a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>For finding conferences, I use <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a> and <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">sessionize.com</a>. They also allow to write your bio and abstract once, find your conferences, and then submit them at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>For the rest, I already wrote a post named <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Advices for junior conference speakers</a> that might be of interest. Expect more to come in the future.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I became exposed to the world of Developer Advocacy through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaruch\">Baruch Sadogursky</a>. He was the one that made me understand by his behavior that public speaking could be a job - or at least a part thereof.</p>\n<p>For the sheer number of talks, I need to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbuxman\">Josh Long</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. As the latter told when he introduced himself during a panel is: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Venkat, I live in a plane‚Äù. And then he passed the mic.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/\">blog where I publish a weekly post</a>. This is also where you can find <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/speaking/\">my list of talks</a>, present and future.
