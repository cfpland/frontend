At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Keanan Koppenhaver and I met through the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-PHP-User-Group/\">Chicago PHP Usergroup</a> last year,\nand since we‚Äôve been fortunate enough to share the stage at Midwest PHP, and share a meal in the airport on the way home.\nSpeaking is always a good chance to meet other people, but it‚Äôs also a fast way to learn new skills. I‚Äôve seen several of\nKeanan‚Äôs talks including one about Alexa and another about serverless functions in PHP. Keanan also has an entrepreneurial\nspirit, which I appreciate, so it was great to learn more about his experience speaking.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mcsi3b6.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi I‚Äôm Keanan and I‚Äôm a developer-turned-CTO and I co-founded <a href=\"https://alphaparticle.com/\">Alpha Particle</a>, a digital consultancy in Chicago. I got into public speaking at one of my previous jobs when we decided that our company should get more involved in the development community. So I started reading up on exactly how conferences decided on talks and started submitting to CFPs!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy all the people I‚Äôve been able to meet as a result of the speaking that I‚Äôve done. <strong>I especially enjoy chatting with people at the speaker dinners or other informal events surrounding the conference.</strong> As far as benefits to my career, some of these connections I‚Äôve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs, new clients and even (arguably) this interview.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at WordCamp Nashville in 2016. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/03/17/keanan-koppenhaver-take-wp-admin-to-the-next-level-with-advanced-custom-fields/\">video is actually online</a>, though I cringe watching it. It was a 20 minute ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù and I remember having to follow an awesome speaker who had the audience on the edge of their seat the entire time. The majority of my talk actually went well, but near the end (~14:00) you can see my heart jump up into my throat when one of my demos didn‚Äôt work correctly! Luckily, I was able to fix it and finish the talk, and <strong>this definitely wasn‚Äôt the last time demos didn‚Äôt work exactly right</strong>.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Between conferences and meetups, I‚Äôve probably spoken at between 20-30 and applied to probably twice that many. I don‚Äôt really apply to conferences that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd be a great fit for, but even then sometimes they just really can‚Äôt take everybody.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><em>Cue Eye of the Tiger montage‚Ä¶</em></p>\n<p>But seriously, I usually just try to get into the room I‚Äôll be speaking in before I have to give my talk (either by getting to the conference early in the morning or during lunch) and make sure my computer can interface with the projector and that the fonts on my slides are readable even in the back of the room.</p>\n<p><strong>I always try to attend the talk before mine in the same room</strong>, just so I can start setting up and doing a final check of everything as soon as the last presenter is done with their talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think there‚Äôs definitely lots of feelings from new speakers around not being knowledgeable enough to start speaking. <strong>But if a conference was only filled with super-advanced talks, they would lose a huge part of their audience.</strong> So, even if you just learned something, you can teach it and many attendees will welcome your perspective as a relatively-recent beginner. <strong>Since you just went through it all for the first time yourself, you know and remember all the roadblocks that someone getting started will have and can help them learn even quicker.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to that, the one thing that started really getting me more speaking opportunities is <strong>submitting multiple talks to each CFP</strong>. Conference organizers sometimes have an agenda of the talks they‚Äôre looking to accept and if you submit more talks, you give them more chances to fit you into the schedule they‚Äôre looking to craft. (However, some conferences specifically say to not submit more than X talks, so definitely abide by that.)</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garybernhardt\">Gary Bernhardt</a>, specifically <a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript\">Wat and The Birth and Death of Javascript</a> just because he manages to inject lots of humor into his talks while still keeping them super informative. I also loved <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en\">Tim Urban on Procrastination</a> just because of both his graphics and the way he walks the audience through his talk.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>I was probably a year into speaking at conferences before I heard about ‚Äúdeveloper relations‚Äù (also called ‚ÄúDevRel‚Äù).\nIt‚Äôs a relatively new field that blends software development and marketing, so many conference speakers get into DevRel (and vice-versa).\nThis week‚Äôs featured speaker, Alex Lakatos runs a great newsletter for developer relations professionals\ncalled <a href=\"https://developeravocados.net/\">Developer Avocados ü•ë Weekly</a>. In addition to that, he has a fantastic story about\nhow he accidentally fell into speaking, so read on to learn more about Alex and his tips for technical speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FDVubKV.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>About 8 years ago, I was a JavaScript Test Developer working for an outsourcer in Romania (I happen to be Romanian), contracting for Mozilla. A friend was organizing this conference called Open Source Open Mind and wanted someone from our team to come to speak about Mozilla and how to get involved. I was terrified of public speaking, but luckily one of my coworkers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ioana_cis\">Ioana</a>, said she‚Äôd do it. Ioana was in the US at a client on-site just before the conference though, so she asked me to do the slides for her. Naively, I accepted, thinking there‚Äôs no harm in it and it‚Äôs the least I could do since she was getting me out of having to be on stage.</p>\n<p>The day of the conference rolls around, and we‚Äôre all in the airport early in the morning, waiting for Ioana‚Äôs flight to land. Just as the airport was listing her flight as ‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù, we got a message from Ioana to go ahead to the conference, and stall as much as possible, she‚Äôll be on the next flight and should be there in time for the last slot of the day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pensacolla\">Marcela</a>, the conference organizer, being a friend, kept pushing Ioana‚Äôs talk further in the schedule. But the last talk of the day comes up, and Ioana is nowhere to be found. So Marcela goes up on stage and looks panicked at the audience, sees me in the front row, and just blurts out: ‚ÄúAnd now, talking about the Mozilla community‚Ä¶Alex is going to talk about the Mozilla community!‚Äú.</p>\n<p>I was dumbstruck, I got on stage and I just sat there quietly for about a minute. And then I started talking and didn‚Äôt stop until the Q&#x26;A part. It was horrible, I had my hands in my pocket the entire time, I made a bunch of rookie mistakes. There is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMnwjpy_3J0\">video of it</a> somewhere on youtube, luckily in Romanian, so not very popular. To this day I still use it as an example of ‚Äòwhat not to do‚Äô during my public speaking training. üòÖ</p>\n<p>When the Q&#x26;A part came, people were a bit on edge, and every time someone bashed Firefox with their questions, I took a step into the audience. I think I finished the Q&#x26;A part literally in the middle of the audience, and trying to make a step to my left to go towards the last person that asked a question. That‚Äôs when I realized maybe it was time to end the talk, well over my allotted time slot.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs how I started speaking in public. A few weeks after that I was MCing one of the community events we had going, someone from the Mozilla Community team saw me and decided that‚Äôs what I was going to do moving forward. I got tons of mentorship from the Mozilla people, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a>, as I was starting out and it just encouraged me to get better and be on stage more often than in the audience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The reason I speak at conferences is simple. I feel guilty about being privileged enough to have gone to a Computer Science University, so <strong>I try as much as possible to help other people get into tech, or get better at tech</strong>. Knowing I helped at least one person by being on stage and sharing my knowledge makes me feel a bit better about that.</p>\n<p>I used to think public speaking was making me a better communicator, so it was helping me indirectly in my career as a JavaScript Developer. But about two years ago I got a job as a JavaScript Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://developer.nexmo.com/team\">Nexmo</a>, and my community work and public speaking was the reason I got the job. So it helped me directly in my career, to the point its part of my day to day work! üòÖ</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mWBqS30hoI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alex Lakatos at View Source</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt really have an exact number, but let‚Äôs go with ‚Äúa lot‚Äù. For context, last year I‚Äôve either spoken, attended, hosted or sponsored 40 events (not just conferences, but smaller meetups as well). If I had to venture a guess based on my slides repo on Github, I‚Äôd say <strong>I spoke at around 50 conferences and meetups so far</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, and it‚Äôs a little embarrassing, to be honest. <strong>I get so nervous before going on stage that I can‚Äôt eat, drink or interact with people.</strong> There is this Psychology of Winning that tells you how to get into a winner mindset, and that calms down my nerves enough to get on stage and start talking. After the first minute or so practice takes over and I actually enjoy being on stage but let me tell you about getting there.</p>\n<p><strong>I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won</strong> (dunno what, but the point is I‚Äôm a winner now!): pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few ‚ÄúHell yeah!‚Äús if I think the toilet it empty (spoiler alert: it rarely is as empty as I think). That makes me think I just won something, I don‚Äôt need to win on stage as well, and it calms my nerves enough so I don‚Äôt shake as I speak.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There are so many things I can list, it‚Äôll just end up being another blog post just for this question. I think there are a lot more resources out there now compared to when I started, so <strong>my advice is just ‚Äúpractice‚Äù. No one did great the first time they got on stage or the second one, but practice makes perfect.</strong> So look at your presentations, identify the areas you could have done better (be it slides, content, posture, delivery), and then find the next conference or meetup where you can practice your talk some more and improve on those points.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for resources on public speaking or want to take the plunge and become a Developer Advocate, I co-curated this newsletter called ‚ÄúDeveloper Avocados ü•ë Weekly‚Äù. If you <a href=\"http://developeravocados.net/\">subscribe</a>, you get a bunch of highly curated articles from the past week in your inbox every Monday, along with a few conferences CFPs that support speakers with travel and accommodation.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>When I started out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertnyman\">Robert Nyman</a> helped me and inspired me a lot.</p>\n<p>Today, I think one of my favorite speakers is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simona_cotin/\">Simona Cotin</a>. I like her Serverless talks a lot, the live coding with a fallback to recordings is something I keep telling people they should do more of in their talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTrHSQbxR-Y' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Simona Cotin at JAMStack</em>conf 2018_</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>I hang out on Twitter these days, so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lakatos88\">follow me there</a>. I‚Äôm hoping my next talk is going to be JSUnconf, but it is an unconference so it‚Äôs a bit uncertain.

One thing I really admire about Joe is his eagerness to help new developers find their way in our industry. While we didn‚Äôt talk about it in this interview, he runs <a href=\"http://chicagoapprenticeships.com/\">Chicago Apprenticeships</a>, a site dedicated to helping bootcamp graduates find their first development job.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>I‚Äôve always looked at Joe as someone who really knows his stuff, so it was interesting to me to hear that Joe still struggles with nerves when he‚Äôs speaking. Remember, people may look like they‚Äôve got it all together on the outside, and still be nervous!</p>\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pUB2xtQ.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Joe! I‚Äôve been in tech for a very long time, and giving talks at conferences for maybe five years. I‚Äôm very much a generalist, so I take a lot of different roles in tech. Overall, though, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve been most interested in making teams more effective lately.</p>\n<p><strong>I was originally on the fence about whether I should give a talk. Too nervous.</strong> While grabbing drinks with someone much more experienced than myself, she basically told me to get over it and just apply. That turned out to be great advice. Since then I‚Äôve given a ton of talks, both soft topics and purely technical ones.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôve been incredibly fortunate to get to meet and become friends with some of my heroes in the industry as a result of speaking at conferences.</strong> That‚Äôs probably the biggest benefit for me. The Ruby community ‚Äî where I give most of my talks ‚Äî is full of supportive, brilliant folks, so that‚Äôs really made me feel good about participating.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs definitely impacted my career. <strong>I still get folks coming to talk to me about talks I gave a few years ago.</strong> I can point to videos of my talks when talking to companies or folks inside my own company. And it let me sharpen my own thinking and discussion skills around tech topics. It‚Äôs been a huge boon.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFuzIWz6Ynk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Joe speaking at Rails Conf, 2017</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Honestly I don‚Äôt think I slept for three days before my first talk. One of the reasons I enjoy giving talks is that I get to work on my fear of speaking in front of crowds. That said, <strong>I always struggle right before I actually get on stage.</strong> I was at a single track conference in a theatre auditorium, which made me feel even more nervous.</p>\n<p>But once I was on stage, I was able to get into a rhythm and really get across the ideas I wanted to convey. And at some point I remembered that I do know and care about my topic deeply. That gave me a lot of confidence. I‚Äôd say it was a success.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to a few dozen. I‚Äôve been accepted at maybe a quarter of those that I applied to? <strong>I have a much easier time getting accepted at regional and US-based conferences.</strong> I‚Äôd really like to do more international speaking, but I think I probably need to have more visibility domestically and focus more on that goal before it‚Äôll happen. I‚Äôm also much more comfortable in communities that I feel attached to (Ruby) than general programming conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Panic? Honestly, I usually spend the morning of a talk walking back and forth clicking through my slides and making sure that I have the major points from that slide down cold. I‚Äôve never been good at preparing to the point where I‚Äôve got my entire talk scripted, so that‚Äôs helpful for me as a routine.</p>\n<p>I probably should script my entire talks, but that‚Äôs not really my speed.</p>\n<p><strong>I do wear the same t-shirt nearly every time I give a talk. That‚Äôs pretty much a ritual at this point.</strong></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Ignore the fear and just apply.</strong></p>\n<p>I can totally understand the impostor syndrome, it‚Äôs hard to make the transition from an audience member to a speaker. It‚Äôs a bit cliche, but I do try to help new speakers remember that <strong>the things that they learned in the past year are totally new material to others</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôd definitely recommend taking advantage of any speaker help that conferences offer.</strong> It‚Äôs a huge boon to get people to listen to your talk ahead of time. There are also lots of articles out there on how to write a good proposal. Overall, let other peoples‚Äô hard won wisdom get you through the early parts.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve had the fortune or misfortune to speak on the same stage as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandimetz\">Sandi Metz</a> before. The clarity of how she conveys deep technical ideas always blows my mind. She‚Äôs definitely the person whose style I‚Äôd like to get better at emulating. If I would just start scripting my talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzWLGMtXflg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Sandi Metz at RubyConf 2017</em></p>\n<p>That said, there are plenty of other speakers with really different styles who all convey ideas really effectively, in really different ways.

You can‚Äôt take someone else‚Äôs voice, and you don‚Äôt need to.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>No conferences on the books now as I‚Äôm adjusting to a new job and hoping to take advantage of being in a company to get more opportunity to give talks.

Her story is inspiring, because as Nicola points\nout, there aren‚Äôt a ton of speakers like her (Australian, female designers) out there.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm an independent product design consultant, working with software teams on their research and design as well as their process. I‚Äôm Australian, but I travel around a lot now days.</p>\n<p>I really had to force myself into public speaking. <strong>I was that girl who was so nervous I felt sick when I had to answer a question in class in front of people in high school.</strong> I was so shy and scared of public speaking. I never, ever thought I‚Äôd be speaking at conferences one day.</p>\n<p>I was lucky later on that I had a manager (Lawrence Crowther) who kept suggesting I give a talk. I think the fact that he saw me as someone who should be on stage was what I needed to feel like I could do it. Then the guy who runs Web Directions in Sydney reached out to me on Twitter after some blog posts I wrote, and specifically said he‚Äôd love to see my application to speak at the conference coming up. They promised speaker training for anyone who wanted it, so I went ahead and applied. Lo and behold, I was accepted‚Ä¶ So then I had to force myself to get comfortable with public speaking in a matter of a few months.</p>\n<p>I really appreciate both of these people for believing I was the right person to be on stage, and encouraging me to do it. <strong>I think to get less represented people on stage, we really need to just ask them more.</strong> It‚Äôs hard to imagine yourself on stage if you‚Äôve never really seen someone like you doing it. I didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd seen many young, Aussie, female designers doing talks, so I guess it just didn‚Äôt really seem like something I could do.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qTCPnIX.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The two things I‚Äôve spoken about most - retrospectives and collaborative user research - are both things I‚Äôm really passionate about. So it‚Äôs just exciting to be able to share information I really think people should have.</p>\n<p>On a more selfish level, <strong>its great to be able to speak about the thing you‚Äôre interested in in front of a lot of people, because it means for the rest of the conference the other people who share your passion will come up and talk to you.</strong> I‚Äôve met some really interesting people. And having spoken about your field at conferences gives you a little boost of initial authority on the subject that you otherwise have to build from scratch every time you meet a new client.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I tested out that my laptop connection and slides were working so many times in the break before my talk that they had to shoo me off stage. And still, the connection totally failed when I got up there in front of 800 people. The AV guy had to actually restart my computer on stage while I was standing there introducing myself at length. Super awkward! But I feel like I swallowed the frog: the possibly worst thing happened the first time. It all had to be uphill from there.</p>\n<p>(For the record, the talk went fine once we got the slides working again!)</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve spoken at 3 conferences, with #4 coming up in June. Two in Sydney one in Kingston, Jamaica (!) and the next in Cornwall in the UK. I‚Äôve applied to a lot more than that!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5mC7jQ3Lto' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Nicola Rushton at WebCraftConf - User Research is for Everyone</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I always try and test out the talk on a real audience or two before the conference.</strong> Whether that‚Äôs at a workplace or a Meetup, I always find things to change and get feedback from people. I will practice my talk probably ten or more times in the few weeks before the conference, just in my house talking to the walls!</p>\n<p>Directly on the day of the talk, I don‚Äôt have much of a routine. If anyone asks me about how I‚Äôm feeling I tell them ‚Äúexcited!‚Äù Even if I‚Äôm actually totally nervous, I find that embodying excitement helps me feel that way. I normally don‚Äôt eat much on the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The most useful thing I have ever been told regarding public speaking was that <strong>the intense rush of adrenaline and nerves before you get on stage is COMPLETELY NORMAL and it happens to everyone, even people who‚Äôve been doing it for years</strong>. In fact, if it stops happening, there‚Äôs something wrong. When I felt like that before, I used to get kind of worried and feel like maybe it would cause me to shake or faint on stage or something. But now I just observe that feeling and think to myself, awesome. My body is giving me all the adrenaline and hormones to do an awesome job of this. And I know it doesn‚Äôt come across on stage (especially if you smile!)</p>\n<p><strong>Think about starting by talking at Meetups, being on panels, or even hosting a Meetup.</strong> Smaller moments of being on stage helped me feel comfortable building up to standing up and speaking for 45 minutes straight.</p>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs also worth saying that representation on stage can be really useful for other people in the audience. Seeing people like you doing things can make someone reconsider whether they might be the right person to do that thing too. <strong>Just by being up there and being yourself you could be encouraging someone else to get up and share the thing they‚Äôre passionate about too.</strong> I find this perspective valuable if I start to feel imposter syndrome.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>One of the most useful things I did for myself when forcing myself to become comfortable with public speaking was to <strong>hold myself to a low standard</strong>.</p>\n<p>That might sound really counterintuitive, but I just told myself at the start that if I got on stage, said everything I wanted to say, and didn‚Äôt trip over myself, then it would be a huge success. Then the next time, I pushed myself to do all of that and one more thing. Then the next time, just a tiny bit better. This allowed me to always feel REALLY positive and successful and happy about my public speaking. I didn‚Äôt want to get into feeling like I didn‚Äôt do good enough, and become discouraged. So really, my goal is to just be myself on stage, have good content, and communicate what I want to communicate in an engaging way.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt compare myself to anyone else!</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://nicolarushton.com/\">www.nicolarushton.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicolarushton\">Nicola on Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/nicola-rushton/\">Nicola on Linkedin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My next conference talk is in <a href=\"https://agileonthebeach.com/sessions/2019/bring-the-team-along-for-the-ride-why-products-are-better-when-agile-teams-do-research-together/\">June at Agile on the Beach, UK</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Nicola Rushton, Overcoming Reluctance to Share Her Passion","path":"/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/04/12","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1npb2OhWZlDsfQEdUPaQu8uTrigII2--w"}}}],"pathPrefix":"content","first":false,"last":false,"index":6,"pageCount":8,"additionalContext":{}}}
