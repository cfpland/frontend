I really enjoy learning from and trading stories with other speakers, so I‚Äôm excited to bring his story to life here on the blog. Like many speakers I‚Äôve interviewed, Scott started off reluctant to get on stage, but has turned one of his biggest weaknesses into an indispensable strength.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"/img/posts/scott-asai.jpeg\" class=\"right\" />\n<p>Up until a few years ago I used to fear public speaking. As an introvert, it was something I avoided throughout high school and college. But one day I realized the reason I was scared was because I let the negative self-talk get into my head. Once I shifted the talk to ‚ÄúI want to be a great speaker‚Äù everything started to change.</p>\n<p>Recently, I made the transition from coaching to speaking full-time because every time I spoke it produced more speaking opportunities and coaching clients. Deep down I love a challenge. Doing something that I viewed as a weakness and turning it into a strength is exhilarating.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like to connect with people individually while I speak on stage. I treat it like coaching, but instead of connecting with one person it‚Äôs many at once. I enjoy sharing information on topics I am passionate about. If I can make the content fun and useful it feels like I‚Äôm helping people.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>Soft Skills. I‚Äôve always loved leadership, but I tried to niche down to soft skills. Hard skills are more marketable, but soft skills are what get your promoted and remembered.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt. I think when I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to speak I may have blanked it out of my mind. I don‚Äôt think I was terrible, but it wasn‚Äôt something I looked forward to at the time.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôd say in the hundreds. Most of them have come in the past year, but I‚Äôve definitely applied to a lot over my career.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/74S8h3BpBPs' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74S8h3BpBPs\">Saving Soft Skills From Extinction</a>‚Äù by Scott Asai at TEDxLaie</em></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Practice more. All the resources in the world don‚Äôt compare to getting on stage and speaking. You‚Äôll make mistakes. It‚Äôs part of growth. Just give yourself more opportunities to get better. Lastly, at some point you have to watch recordings of yourself. As cringeworthy as it may be, it will make you better. No one is a harsher critic of you than you are.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>I really respect <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonsinek\">Simon Sinek</a>. His talk <em>Start with Why</em> is what I go back to when I think of speaking. He‚Äôs also introverted which helps me relate to him. But it feels like he gets in a zone when he‚Äôs speaking. As a sports fan/athlete, I try to get in the zone when I speak too.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>The best way to find me is on my site: <a href=\"https://www.scottasai.com/\">scottasai.com</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

Your proposal was accepted and you‚Äôre officially in the conference program. Now what?</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve been to hundreds of presentations (maybe even more) and you know exactly what makes a presentation memorable: it‚Äôs either REALLY good or REALLY bad. Content aside, it‚Äôs the presentation of your material that makes the most impact to a room full of eager, yet, potentially overwhelmed, conference-goers.</p>\n<p>I believe that everyone has the ability to develop an aesthetic and engaging presentation that will be remembered, so I‚Äôve put together some of my favorite tools to help you do just that. But, if you‚Äôre not quite ready to begin your slide deck yet, first check out my <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/guides/speaking/presentation/\">Guide to Preparing a Conference Presentation</a>.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>The Basics</h2>\n<p>Let‚Äôs start out by talking about some of the most widely-used presentation tools for all purposes and industries. Whichever one you choose, it‚Äôs important not to overload your physical presentation with text. If a viewer sees a slide packed with text, their instinct to read it all will kick in, and they will quickly tune the most important thing ‚Äì you - out.</p>\n<p>Slides and visuals should be used to present key takeaways and help your listener paint the picture you‚Äôre trying to create, not manipulate all of their attention. There is nothing more boring than a conference session that features text-packed slides on plain white backgrounds.</p>\n<h3>Microsoft PowerPoint</h3>\n<p>An oldie-but-goodie, <a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/powerpoint\">PowerPoint</a>, remains the most widely used presentation tool across the board. You‚Äôre probably familiar with it from your school days, and maybe you‚Äôve spent a lot of time playing around with all of the fun effects that you can add in to make your presentation look a lot cooler than it actually was, while procrastinating on developing the actual content for your history presentation (I know I‚Äôm guilty as charged). Nonetheless, PowerPoint is a great go-to for conference presentations. It‚Äôs easy to customize and allows you to add photos, videos, charts, and more right onto your slides, bringing your project or data to life.</p>\n<h3>Google Slides</h3>\n<p>If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Google‚Äôs suite of productivity tools, I highly recommend that you visit Google Drive and play around with creating documents, spreadsheets, and slideshows. The way these tools work is very similar to that of your standard Microsoft Office Suite, but they make collaborating, sharing, and getting feedback a whole lot easier.</p>\n<p>Operating through your browser instead of existing locally on your computer, multiple people can be working on a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/slides/about/\">Google Slides</a> presentation simultaneously, making it the perfect tool for joint presentations. If you want to get feedback from a coworker or mentor, they can easily make suggestions and add comments to your work without actually altering it. Once you‚Äôre done, you can download the presentation to your desktop in many formats, including PowerPoint and PDF, or you can present directly from your browser, making Google Slides a versatile option.</p>\n<h3>Prezi</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://prezi.com/\">Prezi</a> isn‚Äôt your typical slideshow creating platform, but it is just as easy to use as PowerPoint or Google Slides and has been widely adapted over the last several years. Prezi is a great tool to use for highly visual presentations, allowing the user to depict one slide‚Äôs relation to the others, while keeping an eye on larger picture. It‚Äôs made for non-designers (just like us) and the templates are super easy to adapt for any audience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/presentations-2.png\" alt=\"Prezi screenshot\"></p>\n<p>For example, start out with a timeline or overview, and use Prezi to literally zoom in on each specific component of your project. In the sample above, the creator would move into details of the new collection, photos or videos of it, their target demographic, and the inspiration behind it, before returning to this main overview to visually depict how the specifics of the new collection were directly considered in planning for launch events and predicting trends. Prezi‚Äôs website has a lot of great video tutorials that I‚Äôd highly recommend if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with the platform.</p>\n<h2>For Your Code</h2>\n<p>As developers, a lot of what we will be teaching and sharing with others is code-based. As such, a number of great technologies have been created by people like us to help people like us showcase our new coding developments to others.</p>\n<h3>GitPitch</h3>\n<p>As a developer, I‚Äôve always joked that my native language is code. <a href=\"https://gitpitch.com/\">GitPitch</a> must have heard me, because they‚Äôve created a slide deck building platform that operates entirely in my native language‚Ä¶ and they have the tagline to prove it.</p>\n<p>With their desktop tool, you can use Markdown &#x26; Git to create your slide content or take it a step farther with their Markdown Widgets that will help you add special and unique features to your slides. You can even demonstrate the way your code works step by step right inside of your presentation. By natively operating in a language that you‚Äôve become fluent in, GitPitch allows you to build your presentations without the fuss of learning PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Prezi. Your slide decks can be exported into traditional means or presented right through their platform, adding to its utility and versatility.</p>\n<h3>Spectacle Code Slide</h3>\n<p>Similar to GitPitch, Spectacle also allows you to create slides entirely out of code and demo your code right inside of your presentation. That‚Äôs about where the similarities end, however, as Spectacle can run right inside your existing terminal, while GitPitch is a software you would need to download to use. Spectacle is a React.js library that allows you to use JSX or MDX syntax and gives you all of the tools you need to create a sleek presentation for free. It‚Äôs open-source information and their <a href=\"https://formidable.com/open-source/spectacle/\">website</a>, as well as several GitHub users, like <a href=\"https://github.com/jamiebuilds/spectacle-code-slide\">JamieBuilds</a>, can help you get started in Spectacle quickly and easily.</p>\n<h3>Glorious</h3>\n<p>If you want to use a more traditional slide deck platform, like one outlined in The Basics section above, but you would still like to demonstrate your code, <a href=\"https://glorious.codes/demo\">Glorious</a> will be your new best friend. It‚Äôs the easiest way to create an animation of your code in action, giving your audience the evidence they need to prove that your genius idea actually works.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs face it: You can show a block of code and swear it works all day, but without seeing it in action, no one is going to believe you.</p>\n<h3>MarkDeck</h3>\n<p>If you don‚Äôt have code demonstrations that you need to present but you still want to create your slide deck in your native coding language, try <a href=\"https://arnehilmann.github.io/markdeck/\">MarkDeck</a>. MarkDeck will take your files in Markdown format and turn them into an html5 slide deck, while showing the two side by side so that you can easily make adjustments and alter your slide design as needed. Slides follow a simple, standard format, making MarkDeck easy and frill-free for the no-nonsense presenter. It‚Äôs possible to create your own layout if needed, but it‚Äôs more difficult than in GitPitch or Spectacle. If you‚Äôve never coded a slide deck before, MarkDeck in an excellent place to start and get your bearings before moving to something more customizable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/presentations-1.png\" alt=\"MarkDeck screenshot\"></p>\n<h3>Bespoke</h3>\n<p>If your presentation‚Äôs content would be enhanced by using a variety of plugins like animated bullet points or backdrops, hash routing, or touch interaction, Bespoke is just what you need. Its minimal design and modular presentation library foster the ability to highly customize your work, offering over 75 different plugins. You can find a Bespoke.js generator <a href=\"https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke#javascript\">here</a>, and can customize it to meet your needs.</p>\n<h2>To Add a Little Something Extra</h2>\n<p>So, you‚Äôve finished your slide deck and your content is amazing, but it‚Äôs lacking some pizazz and you need to spice it up. Have no fear, the next two tools are here to rescue your presentation from drowning in the deep end.</p>\n<h3>Canva</h3>\n<p>I like to think of Canva as the graphic design mecca for non-graphic designers. Tools and templates within <a href=\"http://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a> allow you to create beautiful, professional-quality graphics, banners, and images without the complexity of Photoshop or InDesign. It‚Äôs a great tool to use to do something as basic as adding text over an image or as complex as using stickers to create an animated graphic that will help illustrate your point.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/presentations-3.png\" alt=\"Canva screenshot\"></p>\n<h3>Unsplash, Pexels, Kaboompics, &#x26; more</h3>\n<p>While we may have grown up with corny, painfully obvious stock photos gracing our teachers‚Äô presentations and textbooks, it‚Äôs 2020 and our own presentations don‚Äôt need to follow suit. There are tons of websites out there that allow you download photos taken by real photographers for free under a Creative Commons license. Some of my favorites are <a href=\"http://www.unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pexels.com/\">Pexels</a>, and <a href=\"https://kaboompics.com/\">Kaboompics</a> because the majority of photos on those sites don‚Äôt look very ‚Äòstock photo-esq.‚Äô Remember, just because you can find an image through a Google search, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you can use it freely without consequence. Take the guesswork out of it and avoid a potential problem by using one of these sites to gather your images.</p>\n<p>As you can see, there many tools out there to help you create beautiful slide decks that will keep your audience engaged and wanting more. While some of the tools outlined here are better for certain scenarios and presentation types than others, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with each of them and give them a try, as much of your decision on which tool to use will come from nothing other than your personal preference. Let me know which ones you like, which ones you don‚Äôt, and if you have other favorites over on twitter at <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/cfp_land/\">@cfp_land</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"10 Presentation Tools for Technology Conference Speakers","path":"/blog/presentation-tools/","category":"Tips","tags":["New Speakers","Experienced Speakers","Tools"],"date":"2020/06/17","image":"/img/posts/presentations-2.png"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><a href=\"https://gotochgo.com/2020/\">GOTO Chicago</a> will be more accessible than ever now that it‚Äôs <a href=\"https://blog.gotocon.com/2020/03/16/better-than-the-real-thing:-goto-chicago-goes-virtual/\">all online</a>, so I‚Äôm excited to\nbring you a speaker story from one of the many great speakers scheduled for the event. Kirk Pepperdine sold the company he founded\nto Microsoft, and now helps build the Java experience for Azure.</p>\n<p>Kirk has spoken at countless conferences (as evidenced by his trove of event badges), and is currently talking about performance\ntuning for Java. In his interview below, he talks about his current work, how he has built up a workshop over years, and what he‚Äôs learned about what people expect out of conference speakers. Read on for more of Kirk‚Äôs story.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your job and how did you get into speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PzxbxD-GRJu4Z3fp-tV5whC-y6POyS9D\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a principle engineer at Microsoft. This all came about as a result of Microsoft acquiring jClarity, a small performance tooling company that I co-founded. Microsoft was looking to build a team of Java experts to help them create the best experience possible for Java in Azure. Plus, Microsoft owns a surprising number of Java assets so adding more Java expertise makes sense. I‚Äôm very humbled to be part of a groundbreaking team inside Microsoft. Right now we‚Äôre tuning a number of internal applications as well as continuing to build out performance diagnostic tooling that we were developing at jClarity.</p>\n<p>As for side projects, I‚Äôm picking at a few ideas in the performance tooling and diagnostic space at the moment. Difficult to say what will see the light of day at the moment but I expect at least one of them will be released sometime this year.</p>\n<p>And there is always <a href=\"https://www.jcrete.org/\">jCrete</a>, an unconference that I cofounded with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heinzkabutz\">Dr. Heinz Kabutz</a>. I don‚Äôt know how, but we‚Äôve managed to create an environment that has attracted a significant number of the most notable names in the Java space. It‚Äôs been very satisfying to watch people come to jCrete, be inspired by the incredible amount of talent and then take that energy and create things with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jitwatch\">JITWatch</a> is an amazing tool that was inspired by Chris Newland‚Äôs understanding of some of the compiler people that he was speaking to. Even more satisfying was watching some of the kids who were tagging along with mum or dad to the conference gain interest in what was going on to the point where they‚Äôd start participating. At least one of the kids took the ideas from jCrete back to her high school and setup an unconference there for a completely un-IT subject.</p>\n<p>That brings me back to the point, when we invite a person to attend jCrete, we don‚Äôt only invite the person, we have invited his or her‚Äôs family or partner whom are perfectly accepted to attend sessions. In a few cases we‚Äôve had spouses and partners propose and lead sessions on topics related to their profession that has relevance to our everyday lives. Having spouses, partners, kids all about creates an amazing atmosphere which is surprisingly beneficial for learning and sharing experiences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like sharing knowledge. To have the chance to share something that may help make a developers life easier or help them better understand how something works is very fulfilling. It‚Äôs also a great time to connect with people, attendees and other speakers to talk tech, toss around ideas, and see the progress others have made on their pet projects.</p>\n<h3>What makes Java performance tuning such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, early on in my career I was not interested performance tuning. I just became the ‚Äúgoto‚Äù guy because I was perceived as having some knack of seeing the source of performance problems and so people kept coming to me when they had issues and I just kept solving them.</p>\n<p>This is how I came to work with Jack Shirazi. We were working together on a project in a bank and after a disastrous false start, management came to Jack and myself and assigned us the glorious task of tuning it. Jack took the experience and our notes to write Java Performance Tuning which was a perennial best seller for O‚ÄôReilly for the longest time. Jack then started <a href=\"http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/\">the companion site (www.javaperformancetuning.com)</a> where I helped him launch. Afterwards we worked together to get the first version of a performance tuning workshop together and before we were ready, people started asking for it. After launch I continued on with the workshop and it‚Äôs been a living work in progress ever since.</p>\n<p>A big part of maintaining and evolving the workshop has been, how can I better describe this point so that I can get a better success rate when people try it out on life like problems.</p>\n<p>From this and my consulting practice I eventually formed the seals of a performance diagnostic process. This immediately had an effect on attendees. I had a tuning exercise that took a couple of hours each day over the 4 days to work through. After I introduced the methodology I started seeing attendees complete the entire exercise in 2 to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing productivity boost. Even better were the emails I‚Äôd get after the workshop ended. People were telling me that they were able to solve long standing nagging problems in minutes. It‚Äôs funny but when people try to customize the workshop for their own companies ‚Äúspecial‚Äù needs they almost always want do drop the methodology section. I never let them do that. It is my opinion that the methodology is the <em>most</em> important topic of the workshop and the final exercises are there just to deepen the understanding of that process.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not going to claim that my methodology is a silver bullet and there isn‚Äôt any other way to tune. Certainly there are others in the industry such as Branden Gregg that has a well thought out methodology. And of course there are others such as Heinz Kabutz, Peter Lawrey, Martin Thompson, Charlie Hunt, Monica Beckwith, Todd Montgomery, Cliff Click, Gil Tene and of course Jack Shirazi and others that I‚Äôve taken inspiration from that have a lot to say on the subject.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at one of the first Devoxx. Jack and I had a two hour session. I remember the room was pretty big and pretty full. <strong>I remember being very nervous about the entire thing and I was very happy when it was over.</strong> I remember the immediate feedback was friendly but I‚Äôd have to say that the materials have matured considerably since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve no idea as I‚Äôve completely lost track. I did keep all of the conference badges. Here‚Äôs a picture of some of them:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1slhdy-kQPgrV7SKJ3P8NdxjTc32eis5V\" alt=\"Conference Badges\"></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Good question, I guess I do. After getting wired up‚Ä¶If there is someone in the audience that I know I‚Äôll sit with them and just talk about nothing in particular. Otherwise I generally just try to clear my mind and relax.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>We generally always have a a session at <a href=\"https://www.jcrete.org/\">jCrete</a> about becoming a better speaker.</p>\n<p>From the years of attending these the common conclusion is <strong>people like stories, they like to be entertained and most importantly they are there to learn something that is relevant to their day to day existence as a developer.</strong> If you can combine all of these elements into a talk then you‚Äôre generally going to be well received and the talk will be memorable.</p>\n<p>For effects, I use diagrams in favor of words, single words instead of walls of text, blank slides when the audience should be focusing on your voice and not be distracted reading a wall of text. When you believe your slide deck is finished, that is the time to start thinking about presentation and how the material fits onto the slides and what can be done to improve the visual aspects of the talk. In my experience, Audiences tend to respond well to desks that say, I cared enough to take the extra time to make this visual appealing.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There is a long list of speakers that I look up to for many different reasons. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heinzkabutz\">Dr. Heinz Kabutz</a> for his mastery of his subject matter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Dr. Venkat Subramaniam</a> for his ability to take an audience on amazing journeys, Adam Bien one of the original live coders, Josh Long, amazing energy and his ability to project it onto the audience, Ted Neward, Cameron Prudy, and the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://gotochgo.com/2020/speakers/1323/kirk-pepperdine\">Kirk Pepperdine and his upcoming talk at GOTO Chicago here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.
