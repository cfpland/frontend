I wanted to offer a little update on how I’m handling things\nwith CFP Land, and what the current recommendations are for people like us who speak at conferences.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>The CFP Land Newsletter Will Continue Weekly Publication</h2>\n<p>First, I am fortunate to have a job that can be done remotely, so my day-to-day schedule won’t change too much. I’ll continue\npreparing and publishing the CFP Land newsletter every week unless I (or someone in my family) gets seriously sick.</p>\n<p>Second, I will update any conferences I hear of that cancel their events, but I could use your help with this. I’m not on every\nevent’s mailing list, so if you see a conference on CFP Land that you know is no longer going to happen, please let me know\nusing the “Report an Issue” link on the CFP:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/report.gif\" alt=\"Report issues on CFP Land\"></p>\n<p>As always, I’m also available by email at <code class=\"language-text\">info@cfpland.com</code>.</p>\n<h2>Consider Preemptively Canceling Any In-Person Events You’re Planning on Attending</h2>\n<p>Seriously, <a href=\"https://trackcorona.herokuapp.com/map\">this thing is global</a>, and probably going to get worse before it gets better.\n<a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/covid-19-what-is-social-distancing-and-how-to-do-it-properly\">Social distancing is the best way to slow its spread</a>, so I can’t imagine many tech conferences are important enough to go to at the risk of thousands of peoples’ lives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/covid-map.png\" alt=\"Global Covid 19 Map\"></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could offer to give any scheduled talks virtually, or as <a href=\"\">Phil Nash</a> is doing, you could switch to live-streaming\nsome coding sessions instead.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Much more will be coming soon, so if you’re interested, <a href=\"/members/\">your CFP Land Pro Membership is just a few clicks away</a>!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"A CFP Land Covid 19 Update","path":"/blog/covid-19/","category":"Updates","tags":["Covid 19","Service Interruptions"],"date":"2020/03/14","image":"/img/posts/covid-map.png"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
