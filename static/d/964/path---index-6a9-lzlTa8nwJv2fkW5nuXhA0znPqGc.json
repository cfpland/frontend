I wanted to offer a little update on how I’m handling things\nwith CFP Land, and what the current recommendations are for people like us who speak at conferences.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>The CFP Land Newsletter Will Continue Weekly Publication</h2>\n<p>First, I am fortunate to have a job that can be done remotely, so my day-to-day schedule won’t change too much. I’ll continue\npreparing and publishing the CFP Land newsletter every week unless I (or someone in my family) gets seriously sick.</p>\n<p>Second, I will update any conferences I hear of that cancel their events, but I could use your help with this. I’m not on every\nevent’s mailing list, so if you see a conference on CFP Land that you know is no longer going to happen, please let me know\nusing the “Report an Issue” link on the CFP:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/report.gif\" alt=\"Report issues on CFP Land\"></p>\n<p>As always, I’m also available by email at <code class=\"language-text\">info@cfpland.com</code>.</p>\n<h2>Consider Preemptively Canceling Any In-Person Events You’re Planning on Attending</h2>\n<p>Seriously, <a href=\"https://trackcorona.herokuapp.com/map\">this thing is global</a>, and probably going to get worse before it gets better.\n<a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/covid-19-what-is-social-distancing-and-how-to-do-it-properly\">Social distancing is the best way to slow its spread</a>, so I can’t imagine many tech conferences are important enough to go to at the risk of thousands of peoples’ lives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/covid-map.png\" alt=\"Global Covid 19 Map\"></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could offer to give any scheduled talks virtually, or as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philnash/status/1238235174829060096\">Phil Nash</a> is doing, you could switch to live-streaming\nsome coding sessions instead.</p>\n<h2>This Won’t Last Forever</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the rush of fear, but I’m an optimist, so I don’t believe this is the end of society as we know it.\nIn a few weeks or months, we’ll all start returning to normal life, and those of us who attend and speak at conferences will likely\nbe back at it. Many conferences scheduled for the Fall are opening their CFPs now, so you might want to continue applying, even if this summer’s events end up changed.</p>\n<p>We also might see a rise in virtual events, which will be pretty cool. While I believe there’s no substitute for actual human contact, virtual events are cheaper, more carbon-friendly, and more accessible to people in developing countries. They provide\na lot of benefits, and those of us lucky enough to be in major tech hubs would do well to remember that.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, and thanks for reading!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"A CFP Land Covid 19 Update","path":"/blog/covid-19/","category":"Updates","tags":["Covid 19","Service Interruptions"],"date":"2020/03/14","image":"/img/posts/covid-map.png"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>I recently mentioned on a podcast <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/career-advancement-through-public-speaking-karl-hughes\">that Twilio was my favorite Developer Relations team</a>, so when Phil Nash of Twilio <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/2020/01/29/how-to-find-cfps-for-developer-conferences/\">mentioned CFP Land</a> in a blog post he wrote, I knew I wanted to get his story up here.</p>\n<p>As many conference speakers do, Phil has a passion for teaching people and sharing his knowledge. You see that in his talks as well as his contributions to open source and helpful blog posts. Read on for his perspective on speaking, technology, and the benefits that getting on stage has given his career.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. What’s your job and how did you get into speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1G9YoZUE9RJzUMGKuzwOhqW82nek6qNsj\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Phil Nash and I am a Developer Evangelist for <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com\">Twilio</a>. I like working with Ruby, JavaScript and anything on the web platform. As an evangelist I spend my days working on example applications, building tools to help developers, and on writing blog posts, documentation and talks.</p>\n<p>Before evangelism I worked as a developer in London in an agency and product studio called <a href=\"https://mintdigital.com/\">Mint Digital</a>, which gave me the chance to work across a number of different styles of project. That was also where I was encouraged to get into public speaking, the company had a great policy that let us attend 2 conferences a year and would support us for more if we got accepted to speak. I seized that opportunity and it led to a few speaking engagements in European conferences, and eventually to this role in evangelism.</p>\n<p>On the side I like <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/\">blogging on my own site</a> and maintaining <a href=\"https://github.com/philnash?tab=repositories\">a bunch of open source applications, rubygems and node modules</a>. I’m also a Google Developer Expert, a <a href=\"https://untappd.com/user/philnash\">lover of beer</a> and now living in Melbourne, Australia.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has absolutely had a direct benefit to my career, it is part of my career now, but that doesn’t stop it being fun too. Something I realised as I started my evangelism career was that <strong>I enjoy speaking because I enjoy teaching people, showing them new things or new ways to achieve something</strong>. Breaking down topics, giving them my spin and hopefully making it entertaining along the way has become a passion.</p>\n<p>That’s what I love about the speaking side of things, but attending conferences in general has led to meeting so many kind, intelligent, community minded people that the best part of speaking is being able to do this more. Anyone can go to a conference and meet people, but if you speak it becomes a lot easier. Most people get a lot out of conferences because they get to listen to and learn from the experiences of those on stage. The real benefits lie in making connections with and learning from the experiences of as many people in the audience too.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I love talking about advancing the web platform. When I got into development professionally the number of features we had available to us to build experiences on the web were very few. The power of things like WebRTC, service workers, speech recognition and push notifications expand the amazing things we can build on the web. I like to experiment with these features and hopefully inspire others to use them in new and interesting ways.</p>\n<p>I also like picking up things that aren’t well understood and going in a bit deeper on them. I did this for two factor authentication, initially wanting to find out exactly how a website and a mobile app could agree on a 6 digit code, and building that into an experience.</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>I just like talking about things I’ve worked on. They tend to be things I’m passionate about and while the audience may learn about that particular project</strong>, I hope they also take away things they can use in their own projects too.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>It seems that my first conference talk is now confined to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160809165416/http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2012/talks/html5-takes-over-the-world\">the Wayback Machine</a>. It was a talk called “HTML5 takes over the world” and was about all the fancy new features of the web back in 2012, including an experimental build of the Opera browser that had the first implementation of <code class=\"language-text\">getUserMedia</code> for getting access to a user’s camera and microphone.</p>\n<p>I remember being very nervous and drinking 3 cups of coffee before getting on stage. <strong>I had a half hour slot for the talk and I stormed through the talk, I think I finished in around 17 minutes and out of breath.</strong> I remember being happy with what I said, but a bit taken aback by the performance itself. At least we had plenty of time for questions.</p>\n<p>To this day I won’t have more than one cup of coffee before getting on stage in case I set myself speaking at double speed again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>After a quick count through my <a href=\"https://philna.sh/speaking/history\">speaking history</a>, it looks as though I’ve spoken at between 70 and 80 conferences since 2012. I’ve applied to so many more though, it’s not even funny. <strong>I must have sent in hundreds of proposals and been rejected hundreds of times too.</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve learned not to take that to heart as each conference organiser or CFP committee member has a different view on the talks they want to see at their event. <strong>A talk may be wrong for once conference and right for another</strong>, which is why it is worth finding the open CFPs and finding the right conference for your talk.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I think my pre-talk routine mostly consists of pacing around and going through the talk in my head. And not drinking too much coffee.</p>\n<p>I still get nervous before crowds, particularly if it’s the first outing of a talk. I don’t think that will ever go away fully, so I embrace it. I don’t have rituals or anything that makes it better so I just try to use the nervous energy to my advantage.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Every person that gets on a stage to give a talk to an audience is up there telling their story and if you want to give a talk on something you need to find your angle on it. When you include your experiences it makes your talk unique. <strong>I could happily watch presentations on the same piece of code by 10 different people because I bet I would learn something new from each of them.</strong> You are the world’s foremost expert on your own experiences, and I believe that needs to come across in your presentation. That way you can’t be an imposter because no-one else has had your experience.</p>\n<p>When it comes to finding conferences to apply to, I recently wrote up a <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/2020/01/29/how-to-find-cfps-for-developer-conferences/\">list of different sites and mailing lists you can use to keep up to date with open CFPs</a> (including <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a> of course).</p>\n<p><strong>The most important thing for giving talks is to practice, out loud.</strong> You don’t need to have an audience to practice to, but running through the slides and saying the words you want to say out loud will stick them in your head much better for when you come to say them in front of other people. Nothing can substitute rehearsal for ensuring you are prepared when it comes time to speak.</p>\n<p>If you are speaking at a conference, I’d recommend giving your talk to a local meet-up first too. That way you can get a good gauge on what the audience thinks of it, anything useful you might have missed and what the questions might be. It also forces you to practice at least once before you get to the conference.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Oh so many people. I’ve been fortunate to have been at so many conferences and seen so many speakers that I have inspiration all around. I already know I’m forgetting so many people as I write this following list, but here’s some fantastic people off the top of my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All my fellow (and former) developer evangelist colleagues at Twilio, they both inspire me and also challenge me to improve all the time</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie\">Charlie Gerard</a> for her amazing side projects leading to AI and web powered live demos</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> for her ability to break down the most complicated parts of CSS and make anyone understand</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tenderlove\">Aaron Patterson</a> for taking the deepest of dives into how Ruby works but doing so in a flurry of puns</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/erinjzimmer\">Erin Zimmer</a> for digging into browsers, Angular and web components and making them accessible to all</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And many, many more.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers</h3>\n<p>You can find me almost anywhere on the internet as <em>philnash</em>, from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philnash\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/philnash\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/philnash/\">LinkedIn</a> to my own site, <a href=\"https://philna.sh\">philna.sh</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m also streaming <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/phil_nash/\">live coding on Twitch frequently</a>, so come say “Hi! 👋” sometime!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

What’s your job and how did you get into speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yyA2nhTlljFPRekzmVd_zjywJuhKRUYo\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I run developer relations at a startup spun out of U.C. Berkeley, called <a href=\"https://anyscale.io/\">Anyscale</a>. We’re developing the open-source <a href=\"https://ray.io/\">Ray</a> system for distribution of Python tasks from single machines to clusters, specifically to optimize compute scenarios in reinforcement learning, hyper parameter tuning, model serving, and other compute-intensive Python applications.</p>\n<p>I started speaking at conferences over a decade ago when I first did consulting. I’ve worked in a range of roles, from engineer to VP-level management, to evangelism, and in different industries, from embedded systems and medical electronics to Internet and Big Data startups.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I enjoy public speaking, defining and delivering the arc of a story about a particular software development. I also show off my personal photography in my slides. ;)</p>\n<p><strong>It has been a huge boost to my career, both for establishing name recognition and expertise in the areas I’ve worked, as well the useful things you learn meeting a diverse range of people facing a broad list of challenges.</strong> It has been an important part of my job for most of the last 15 years or so.</p>\n<h3>What makes scaling distributed systems (and Ray in particular) such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>What attracted me to Ray is the thought that went into its design to provide a very accessible API for developers, which is easy to use, yet frees the developer from having to understand a lot of details about distributed systems. Behind that API is a very performant implementation that scales extremely well for a variety of workloads. I’m also very interested in ML approaches like reinforcement learning, so I’m learning a lot about them, as well.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>It was “Panel on the future of Aspect Oriented Programming” (with a few other speakers) at JBossTwo Conference, June 2003, San Francisco. I think it was recorded, but I believe it’s long since disappeared. I was nervous at the time, but really enjoyed the opportunity.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Easily over 30 or so.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCW5y4_8uGU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Fast Data Architectures for Streaming Applications by Dean Wampler</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I’ve done it so much that I don’t get nervous very often anymore. I mostly just make sure I’m well rested, well hydrated, and I’ve reviewed the slides beforehand so the sequence of them is familiar and I’m comfortable with the phrasing I want to use for each slide.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a topic you are really interested in, so you’re motivated to work hard to make your talk the best it can be.</li>\n<li>Recognize that we’re all learning to one degree or another; be honest about what you know and don’t know.</li>\n<li>People enjoy hearing war stories and your quest to learn the subject, etc.</li>\n<li>When writing proposals, the most important thing is to put yourself in the mind set of an audience member. What will attract them to your talk? What’s there for them to learn? I’ve <a href=\"https://medium.com/@deanwampler/tips-for-effective-conference-proposals-5997c9d40005\">written a whole blog post</a> about this subject.</li>\n<li>Finally, practice your talk and remove stuff so you have plenty of time and don’t overwhelm your audience with wordy, busy slides that you rush through!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/randyshoup\">Randy Shoup</a> has given clear, inspiring talks about “peopleware”, inspiring people from tech history, etc. When I hear a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CatSwetel\">Cat Swetel</a> talk, I learn a lot of new ideas about project management and team processes.
