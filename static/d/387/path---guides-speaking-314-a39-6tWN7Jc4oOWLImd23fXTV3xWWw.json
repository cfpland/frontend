The community has been amazingly welcoming and helpful, so this month, I wanted to give something back to the community by releasing a comprehensive guide I’ve been compiling for current and aspiring technology conference speakers.</p>\n<p>Because everyone reading this will start at a different level of experience speaking, I wanted to break the advice down into manageable chunks. These “chapters” can be read independently, or straight through as you see fit.</p>\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"./speaking/introduction/\">An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"./speaking/why-speak/\">Why Speak?
