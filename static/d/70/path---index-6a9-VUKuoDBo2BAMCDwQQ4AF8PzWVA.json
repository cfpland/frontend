Now that I’m aware of the CFP process, I’m speaking regularly at conferences across the country.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/\">Laura Janusek</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there is variability in how an event decides on which speakers they will invite, most technology conferences offer some form of public Call for Proposals (“CFP”). When conference organizers start planning their event, they usually choose a date, and soon after, they will open up a CFP. The CFP may be managed on a platform like <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">Sessionize</a> or <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">PaperCall</a>, and promoted through channels like <a href=\"/\">CFP Land</a>.</p>\n<p><em>More tips for finding CFPs are available in <a href=\"../finding-cfps/\">Section 4: Finding and Selecting CFPs</a>.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to accepting public submissions, many conferences will invite specific speakers - especially those they’ve identified as possible keynote speakers. It takes a while to get recognized as a possible keynote speaker, and by that point, you’ll likely have met many of the conference organizers already. So, most speakers start by submitting their talk proposals to open CFPs.</p>\n<p>Because most conferences get hundreds of submissions, they use an orderly process to evaluate and select talks. I’ve heard of conferences using one or more of the following methods, but others may also exist:</p>\n<h3>1. Rolling Review</h3>\n<p>Some conferences start reviewing submissions as soon as they come in. This helps the reviewers keep from getting overwhelmed by evaluating hundreds of submissions all at once, but it means that the conference may not have enough spots for late submissions. Sometimes conferences will advertise that they evaluate submissions on a rolling basis, but many do not, so if you’re really serious you might want to email the organizers to ask.</p>\n<p>In the case of rolling reviews, it pays to submit your abstract or proposal early.</p>\n<h3>2. Public Voting</h3>\n<p>Other conferences open up all submissions to public opinion. I’ve usually seen this in the form of an open voting period, so speakers are expected to help promote their session. The upside to the conference is that they build community awareness for the event, and have an easier time selecting talks. The downside is that voters may or may not actually attend the conference, and they may not select a diverse range of topics or speakers. Usually, the conference organizers will mix open voting with some personal selections to ensure a good balance.</p>\n<h3>3. Post-Deadline Review</h3>\n<p>The majority of conference organizers I’ve spoken to wait until all submissions are turned in and the deadline has passed before reviewing them. While this creates a huge backlog of abstracts to review, it allows the organizers to ensure a good mix of talks and not give any preference to early submissions. In this case, submitting early won’t help you, but you really need to work hard to make your proposal stand out.</p>\n<h2>Notifying and Confirming Speakers</h2>\n<p>Sometime after the review process ends (or during it in the case of rolling review), the conference organizers will reach out individually to each speaker they’ve selected. Because speakers often apply months before they hear back, the organizers want to confirm that the speaker is still interested and available. If not, they may invite another speaker to replace them.</p>\n<p>This is the reason that conferences are typically very slow to send rejection emails - if they send them at all. But it also means that even if a conference starts to announce speakers, they aren’t necessarily done with the selection process. You may still have hope!</p>\n<p><em>More on handling success and rejection is available in <a href=\"../success-rejection/\">Section 6: Dealing with Success or Rejection</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Why Do Speakers Get Chosen?</h2>\n<p>Assuming the conference is not using public voting to select speakers, it’s almost impossible to predict exactly what will stand out to a conference organizing committee. Each one is different, and each conference has different stated (and unstated) objectives. It certainly helps if you have been to the conference before (or have seen the sessions they selected in the past), but even then, things can change.</p>\n<p>While there are many factors involved, technology conference speakers are usually chosen based on some combination of the following criteria:</p>\n<h3>1. Great Topic and Abstract</h3>\n<p>Writing a great conference proposal (or abstract) is an art. It takes a mix of skills - writing, storytelling, and creativity among them - but a great abstract for one conference won’t necessarily work at another. The most successful speakers submit multiple abstracts and tailor each to the conference they’re targeting.</p>\n<p><em>Much more on writing and submitting a successful abstract is available in <a href=\"../submitting/\">Section 5: Submitting Abstracts</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>2. A Good Blend of Topics</h3>\n<p>Most conferences want a mix of sessions because attendees are often looking for different things. Some want to be inspired by the big picture sessions and keynotes; others want to learn specific niche technologies from experts; others are just curious, and want to know what’s trending.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having big picture sessions can make for a very generic program. As such, a limited number of big picture presentations tend to get picked with a larger number of more specialist topics.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Experienced organizers usually shoot for a good blend so they can maximize the value to attendees.</p>\n<h3>3. Speaker Reputation</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0F3l9Qh.jpg\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Famous speakers will tend to attract money, in the form of more/better sponsors and more attendees.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Developing a reputation as a speaker takes time, but once you’ve done it, organizers will likely give you a leg up over new speakers. It’s not fair, but it makes some sense - there’s always a risk that a first-time speaker will get too nervous and flake out before the event - plus widely known speakers may actually draw an audience on their own.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The biggest conferences may have selection processes that favor experienced speakers, since they don’t want to risk a 50-minute time slot on an unknown quantity.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the same time, conference organizers are annoyed by overly self-promoting talks too. Speakers who can’t stop talking about themselves will gain a negative reputation that’s just as hard to overcome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Program committees often don’t want ego-ridden sessions, not just because they are annoying, but also because they often become advertising carousels for the speaker’s books, videos, events, and other material they are schlepping.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Speaker Qualifications</h3>\n<p>Just because a speaker is new does not mean that they don’t know what they’re talking about. I’ve met a lot of speakers with 20+ years of experience in their field, so it’s pretty safe to say they’re qualified to give a talk - even if they haven’t before. That said, even qualified speakers need to show the organizers that they’re qualified in some way, so writing blog posts, books, or courses can be a good way to demonstrate your knowledge even before you start speaking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Why should I listen to them? Are they an amazing speaker and will give a great performance? Are they an expert in a field that they can speak authoritatively on? Do they have some unique experience that makes their content special or different?…Did you win “best comedic presentation” at your local toastmasters? Were you in every theatre play and musical production in school? Did you write an open source tool or library that deals heavily with the topics involved? Have you spoken before?\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>5. Diversity of Speakers</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are many that simply won’t see what’s in front of their eyes. They are completely unaware of how unwelcoming many technical events are for those with diverse backgrounds. There is a reason it is like it is.\n<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DBAKevlar/status/1166767440547549184\">Kellyn Command Line</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Speaker diversity comes in many forms, but some examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training and education</li>\n<li>Race and ethnicity</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\n<li>Socioeconomic background</li>\n<li>Company and team size</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While some organizers ignore speaker diversity, it is <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">becoming a bigger issue for many conferences and speakers</a>.</p>\n<h3>6. Cost of Transportation and Hotel</h3>\n<p>If the conference offers perks like free travel and hotel for speakers, they often must consider this cost when selecting speakers. In other words, even if your abstract is great, some small conferences won’t be able to fly you halfway across the world just to speak. You can get around this limitation if you (or your employer) is willing to cover the cost, so be sure to mention that in your application.</p>\n<h3>7. Event Sponsorship</h3>\n<p>Finally, some technology conferences give dedicated speaking slots to sponsors. If you work in developer relations or you’re hiring a lot of people, your employer may be willing to sponsor some events in exchange for some stage time.</p>\n<p>Now that you’re familiar with how conferences choose speakers, it’s time find some open calls for proposals (CFPs). The next section covers this in depth as well as some of the ways you can ensure the event you’re applying to is worth your time.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../why-speak/\">Previous: Why Speak? 11 Reasons People Get on Stage</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../finding-cfps/\">Next: Finding and Selecting CFPs</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"How Conferences Choose Their Speakers","path":"/guides/speaking/how-conferences-choose/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":"https://i.imgur.com/scKOuP1.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Once you’re very well established as a technology conference speaker, you might start getting invited to speak, but for most speakers, this takes a long time if it happens at all.

Contact the Conference Directly</h3>\n<p>If you are focused on just a few specific conferences, you could reach out directly to each of them to express your interest in submitting. Many conferences start planning 6 months before the event, so they might be looking for CFPs early. That said, some organizers may not start working until 3 months before the event, or they might not have time to answer every email individually. In this case, you’ll end up spending a lot of time chasing them.</p>\n<p>In most cases, it’s unnecessary to ask a conference directly when their CFP will open as they’ll probably post something about it on their website. But, it’s worth mentioning because some conferences never hold an open CFP, so you have to reach out directly.</p>\n<h3>2. Subscribe to the Conference’s Website or Newsletter</h3>\n<p>Assuming the conference holds an open CFP, they’re likely to tell as many people as they can about it in their blog or newsletter. If you’re targeting a few specific conferences, this might be the best way to ensure you don’t miss their CFPs. Be careful counting on conference newsletters too much though. Some organizers are not very good at sending them, and they may forget to publicize their CFP that way.</p>\n<p>It will be annoying to check every conference website you’re interested in submitting to every few weeks, but it may be the only way to ensure you don’t miss a certain CFP.</p>\n<h3>3. Social Media</h3>\n<p>Twitter is probably the most popular social network for technology conferences and speakers, so you may want to start following people there. Following individual conferences will get you started, but there are a number of good accounts that tweet out about open CFPs. You can also save a few Twitter searches to accomplish this goal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">Tae’lur Alexis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Use a CFP Aggregator</h3>\n<p>I’m biased towards this one - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/how-cfpland-came-to-be/\">that’s why I started CFP Land</a> - but it’s also the most convenient method if you want to apply to speak at a lot of conferences. <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">Confs.tech</a>, and <a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">CallingAllPapers</a> are the most comprehensive CFP aggregators, but there are other niche topic aggregators as well. At CFP Land, we add the perks that speakers can expect from the conference, but you could also look that information up yourself on each conference’s website.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these aggregators have a list of open CFPs and some of them offer a newsletter or email alerts as well. The biggest downside to a CFP aggregator is that you’re bound to miss some conferences that they aren’t aware of. I’ve collected over 1200 conference CFPs in the past two years, but every month subscribers submit dozens of new ones that I didn’t know existed.</p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Never miss a speaking opportunity again.</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to the CFP Land newsletter to get new CFPs delivered to your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Deciding Which CFPs to Submit to</h2>\n<p>As you start learning more about the wide array of conferences out there, you’ll discover that there are likely more open CFPs than you have time to submit to. Every speaker must decide which conferences are worth their time, so while you may not be as picky when you’re just getting started, it’s certainly worth considering the following criteria with each CFP.</p>\n<h3>1. Topic Area</h3>\n<p>You don’t have to have a complete talk ready before you start submitting abstracts to open Calls for Proposals, but you should have some idea what kind of topics you want to speak about. While conferences will usually look for a range of talks, you are never going to get a Ruby talk accepted to a Python conference. Plus, as Nick points out, that Python conference may not be interesting to you anyway:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Maybe you can get your talk on web accessibility accepted at DjangoCon, but if you aren’t interested in Python, then the rest of the conference will be of minimal value to you.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most conferences will provide information about the topics and kinds of talks they want on the CFP page, but if they don’t take a look at videos or listings of the previous year’s talks. This should give you some idea what they are looking for.</p>\n<h3>2. Location</h3>\n<p>One of the first conferences I spoke at was Codemash, and while I loved the event, traveling to Sandusky, Ohio in January is not always pleasant. As you look for conferences, you may want to prioritize those in locations that would be fun to visit or where you have friends or coworkers.</p>\n<p>I’ve actually spoken at some conferences that did not pay for my hotel because I had a friend in town I could stay with anyway. This makes it easier for the conference to support you financially, plus I got to hang out with an old college friend who lives on the other side of the country.</p>\n<h3>3. Financial Viability</h3>\n<p>Getting accepted to speak at a conference in Thailand may sound great, but if they don’t cover your flight costs, you might be paying several thousand dollars just to get there. Most conferences will list the speaker perks they offer on their website, but if not, you can email the organizers directly to ask. In my experience, about 30% of tech conferences cover travel and hotel costs for their speakers, and about 1% offer an extra stipend.</p>\n<p>Another way to fund your speaking excursion might be to turn to your employer. Some companies offer an education budget to employees, and attending a conference - even as a speaker - is certainly an educational experience. You could also make the argument that you’ll help your employer raise awareness of their product or any open job listings while you’re there. It may or may not work, but it’s worth trying.</p>\n<p>Finally, many conferences offer other perks to speakers - whether they can cover travel or not. For example, I’ve seen conferences offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free speaker training sessions</li>\n<li>Airport transportation</li>\n<li>Speaker’s dinner</li>\n<li>Gift bags or cards for speakers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these add-ons may help make speaking more financially viable, but to be honest, most new speakers will not get paid much for their speaking directly.</p>\n<h3>4. Reputation</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not all conferences are born equal: whether you like it or not, there’s a “coolness” factor attached to each of them.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether you call it “coolness” or “reputation” or “prestige”, it’s true that not all conferences hold the same weight. Many smaller, regional conferences are more like a big meetup, so speaking there may not be that difficult. On the other hand, some huge tech events are extremely competitive and aim to only accept world-class speakers. Either way, there’s no harm in applying to speak at a conference that you feel is “above your pay grade.” The only way to move up is to go for it!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I recommend looking at videos from prior years and looking at the conference website, to see if it appears to be the work of conscientious, detail-oriented, experienced people.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you may start by applying at smaller, newer conferences, it is a good idea to look into how the conference has been run in the past. Do they treat their speakers and attendees well? Are the organizers well-known? Do they have a good reputation? Ask around if you don’t know anyone who’s been to the event personally.</p>\n<p>Finally, consider whether or not you want to take a risk by speaking at a first time conference. I have had good and bad experiences with new events: one had to cancel the event due to lack of interest, and the other was an awesome conference run by very professional and experienced people. Talk to the organizers and do what you can to understand their vision for the event.</p>\n<h3>5. Commitment to Diversity</h3>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, you should know whether the event has a commitment to diversity and will provide a welcoming environment for all attendees and speakers. You don’t want to be attached to an event that gets bad press for excluding people or allowing hostile behavior. Look for a code of conduct, ask the organizers about this, and take a look at their speaker lineup from previous years. I - like many speakers - believe that <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">conferences should choose speakers that reflect the diversity of the communities they hope to serve</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you start to find conferences that would be a good fit for you, it’s time to write and submit your first abstract. The next section outlines some tips from experienced speakers and conference organizers about how to get your abstract accepted.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\"
