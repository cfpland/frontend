How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m a Lead Designer at 8th Light, a custom software consultancy. I do UX and front-end development and work with various clients on designing and building their software.</p>\n<p>I was never interested in public speaking, but before I became a designer about 3 years ago I worked at an education-focused non-profit, and have a background in teaching, so I’ve always been pretty comfortable in the very small scale stage of a classroom. Before I started at 8th Light I volunteered doing a workshop about domestic violence, and part of my apprenticeship involved doing a talk for a small group of people, and I did that workshop.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of positive feedback, and eventually did a version of it at our internal company conference. A while later, a co-worker who was organizing a Ruby conference asked me to do a short talk about how developers could do quick usability testing, so that they could have good UX of features they were building when there wasn’t a designer in the room. That talk went pretty well despite the fact that I felt like I was going to pass out the entire time.</p>\n<p>I did that talk at another conference, but quickly felt a strong urge to go back to speaking about something I really cared about. I had been thinking for a long time about the ways that technology enables domestic violence, and had been collecting examples, but never felt like I was an “expert” enough to do a talk about it. It really seemed like something that other, smarter people were working on. But eventually I realized that wasn’t true, that if someone out there was already talking about this stuff, I couldn’t for the life of me find them.</p>\n<p>Right around that time, Russ Unger, who leads UX Camp in Chicago, responded to a proposal I’d submitted saying my topic wasn’t quite right, and he asked “is there anything else you’ve though about doing a talk about?” I told him about my idea for a talk about how tech enables domestic violence, and he said that would be perfect for the conference. I owe him a lot for taking the time to figure out that this talk was on my mind and giving me what I needed to finally do it. It took dozens of hours of research and stitching together stories from news articles and people who had disclosed their experiences to me to make my talk, but I finally did it, and ever since UX Camp I’ve had a lot of success with it.</p>\n<h3>What do you focus on speaking about?</h3>\n<p>My speaking is all about how technology enables domestic violence; how abusers can utilize technology to further their power and control over their victims, and how products that don’t enable abuse but are clearly spaces where survivors are taking certain actions that disclose the abuse and meaningful intervention could be provided (“Survivor” is the preferred term instead over “victim”, since it speaks to the person’s ability to endure and survive a dangerous situation.)</p>\n<p>I tell a story about someone experiencing domestic violence in 5 different areas, give stats that correlate to those areas, and describe ways that more thoughtful design or building of the product could prevent the abuse. The 5 areas are financial abuse through online banking tools, harassment and monitoring through “smart” home devices/Internet of Things devices, stalking through GPS-enabled devices, personal security through software such as building management software, and how fitness, wellness, and pregnancy products could be a place of meaningful intervention.</p>\n<p>I think it goes without saying that domestic violence is a worthwhile thing to do a talk about, but just in case you need convincing, here are some stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 in 3 American women will experience severe physical abuse at the hands of an intimate partner.</li>\n<li>For men, that number is 1 in 4. Domestic violence is not an edge case.</li>\n<li>The number one cause of death among pregnant women in America is murder by her current or ex intimate partner.</li>\n<li>3 women are murdered by their current or ex intimate partners in America each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I don’t see myself as a “public speaker” - I really just want to spread the content of my talk because I think it’s really important.</p>\n<p>But I’ve learned a few things: <strong>first, as someone who gets a lot of stage fright, the only thing that helps is just doing it a bunch.</strong> After 4 or 5 times talking a stage, it started to get a lot easier. After doing it a bunch and not dying, you start to realize it’s going to be ok. That’s the advice I give people who ask about speaking even though they’re not a natural public speaker - you have to just do it, but then it quickly gets a lot easier.</p>\n<p><strong>The second thing I like about speaking at conferences is that I also get to attend them!</strong> I think I’ve grown in my career more rapidly than average in part because of attending half a dozen conferences in the past few months and learning a ton. My advice is to focus on applying to conferences you’d actually want to attend, so that they’re also a learning experience for you. I can only do so many conferences in a year, so I figure I might as well prioritize speaking at ones I also want to attend.</p>\n<p><strong>The third thing I like is that speaking at conferences unexpectedly helped with my social anxiety a lot.</strong> I’m introverted and socially anxious, but so many days of having strangers come up and talk to me about my talk, and share their experiences with violence, was the intense exposure I needed to start to get past my social anxiety. Within 6 months, I’ve become so much more confident talking to strangers and being in new situations that would have induced a lot of anxiety in the past - all thanks to conference speaking. I really want people to know that you can be introverted, awkward, and socially anxious, and still be a great conference speaker and get a ton of benefit from doing it.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>7 so far, with a few more confirmed for the fall - include StrangeLoop, which I almost didn’t apply to because it seemed like such a long shot! I’ve applied to about 40, and gotten 10 rejections, with the other 23 still up in the air.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhWPnKg4oK4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Eva PenzeyMoog: Designing Against Domestic Violence</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Deep breathing! And lots of practice, to the point that you don’t need to rely on speaker notes. It makes such a difference.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Two things:</p>\n<p><strong>You do NOT need to have the talk written before you write a proposal for that talk to apply to conferences with, and you do NOT need to already be an expert in the field that you’re proposing a talk about.</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling like you need to know and do so many things before even applying to something you might get rejected from is a surefire way to get overwhelmed and never start. Choose something you’re legitimately interested in and would want to become an expert in, write the proposal and apply to as many conferences as possible. Once you get accepted to one, then create the talk and learn all about it. You don’t need to present the answers in your proposal. I wish someone had spelled this out for me earlier on - I would have started applying with this talk a lot sooner!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie\">Sara Wachter-Boettcher</a> is a huge inspiration. She keeps it real - she’ll call out the chatbot you’re using at your conference for defaulting to a woman’s name, and point out all the ways Facebook is terrible when a table full of Facebook designers is right in front of her. I really value that, and before her, had seen plenty of men behave that way, but no women. She’s not afraid to hold people accountable, but doesn’t make it personal. She strikes a perfect balance, and getting to see her speak and attend one of her workshops was incredibly valuable to see as I’m working on developing my own speaking style. I was lucky enough to randomly be seated with her at a shared table at a restaurant we were both at after I saw her talk at a conference, and got to ask her all my questions and get amazing advice. I think that was the moment I started to feel like the universe really wants me to do this work. Serendipitous things like that keep happening. And I’m trying to pay it forward - I’m all about getting more women and other underrepresented voices into the conference speaking circuit.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My website is <a href=\"https://evapenzeymoog.com/\">evapenzeymoog.com</a> and my Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/epenzeymoog\">@epenzeymoog</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Eva PenzeyMoog, Designer Helping Stamp Out Domestic Abuse","path":"/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/26","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PZhgAIc.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I started my career as a UX designer at a design agency. <strong>Being an introvert, I was very uncomfortable speaking in meetings and used to literally run away from having the spotlight on me.</strong> I even had a hard time speaking in front of my own team. Each time I stood up to talk I would get the classic symptoms such as dry mouth, profuse sweating, and forgetting what I wanted to say. It was frustrating because I noticed others who would get up and speak effortlessly and I wanted that for myself. I wanted to be able to get up and speak without hesitation and share my ideas.</p>\n<p>It was time to act.</p>\n<p>So I decided to turn things around and searched for ways to improve my public speaking skills. My search led me to a 30-day online speaking challenge which focused on specific areas in public speaking such as speed, filler words, pacing, etc. The last exercise of the challenge was to create a presentation of my own and record myself presenting it. At that time I was also diving into the world of sketching so I created a 5-minute talk about sketching journey. To test out my presentation I needed real people to present it to so I searched for meetups and found a developer meetup which was looking for presenters for their next meetup. Their CFP page was very inviting towards new speakers which gave me the confidence to apply. I jumped on the chance and submitted my talk proposal and that’s when my public speaking journey began.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>For me, it’s all about the people. Whether it’s someone who connects with my message or another speaker who is just starting out, I love meeting new people and making friends at conferences.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don’t know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of speaking at conferences is that each conference brings its own challenges such as room layouts, the acoustics of rooms, the size of the audience, the distance to the audience, lighting, etc. these all present challenges that help us grow.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first conference talk very clearly because it was started out a bit rough. I was really nervous before the event because I didn’t know anyone in the sea of people. The layout of the room I was presenting it was a bit challenging. There was a big column right in the middle of the room which divided the audience into two sides. The windows were from floor to ceiling which sounds nice but made it extremely difficult to see my slides. We had to turn off the lights to be able to see them so I presented my talk in the dark, talk about throwing you off your game. As I began my presentation I noticed the people in the audience with their expressionless stares which made me think I was boring them. This started the negative self-talk in my head while I was presenting which never turns out well and it caused me to read my slides instead of looking at the audience. Towards the end, I felt much better and more in control of my talk. After the event, I felt a bit disheartened but I was determined to learn from the events of the day and improve for the next time.</p>\n<p>Each new talk presents challenges and opportunities to learn from and to help us grow. I am still learning from my “mis-takes” and addressing the areas I need to improve in. It’s important to keep in mind that public speaking is a continuous learning process. Never stop learning.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/REn0gvq.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I haven’t kept count but I know I have applied to many conferences. My CFP rejected-to-win ratio is probably around 0.00001 which is definitely an exercise in learning how to accept rejection and not take it personally.</p>\n<p>I have presented at 6 conferences in the US and in Europe. My talk recently was accepted at a conference in Oslo which improves the ratio just a little bit.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>A week before my talk, my routine consists of getting a fresh haircut and picking out the outfit I will wear. I also make sure I have all the dongles, adapters, cables, remotes I need.</p>\n<p>On the day of the talk, I make sure I have a good breakfast and pack a few snacks just in case I get hungry before the talk.</p>\n<p>If I am speaking at a conference, I make sure to scope out the room I will be presenting in beforehand to check out the stage and seating arrangements. This way I can visualize myself up on the stage presenting beforehand, which help me feel prepared.</p>\n<p>Right before giving my talk I will do some breathing exercises, and if I really need to get pumped up then I will find stairs nearby and go up and down them quickly to warm up and get my blood flowing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>I recommend new speakers look for opportunities to present at work, meetups, schools, basically anywhere they can.</strong> At work, you can present at a Lunch and Learn session. Don’t have a Lunch and Learn session at work? Why not start one? This will give you the opportunity to present regularly and get more practice. Meetup organizers are always looking for new people to present and share their ideas. You can also start off with Lightning Talks which are short 5-minute presentations on any topic you want and are a great entry point to start your public speaking journey.</p>\n<p>Another tip I like to share is to make your talk interactive. <strong>Find ways to get your audience engaged with your message through exercises, questions, or discussions.</strong> Getting the audience involved will help them connect with your message on a deeper level and when the audience is engaged I notice that I relax more and become less anxious since.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Inspiration is everywhere. Whether it’s a team member presenting at work, a speaker at a conference, or kids presenting at an elementary school, I find inspiration by observing people and how they communicate. I have presented my talks at elementary schools and I’m especially inspired by the confidence kids have in standing up and sharing their ideas without hesitation which is something I am working towards.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>A good thing about having a somewhat unique name is that if you Google Rizwan Javaid, I will show up. Not personally, that would be creepy but the search results will be mostly about me.

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Like many speakers I’ve interviewed, Mike Miles understands that working in technology is about much more than just writing\ncode. While he has done plenty of that, Mike started speaking to raise his confidence and force himself to learn something new.\nNow, in addition to speaking at dozens of conferences, Mike hosts a podcast called Developing Up, which covers a wide range of\nnon-technical topics for software developers. We spoke about some of the <a href=\"https://www.developingup.com/episodes/43\">advantages of public speaking</a>\nfor your career on the show, but in this interview, Mike goes into some of his tips and the opportunities that speaking\nhas afforded him as well.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>Since 2009 I have worked at <a href=\"https://www.wearegenuine.com/\">Genuine, a full service digital agency headquartered in Boston MA, USA</a>. My current role is V.P. of Development, which entails leading the development department and the individuals in it. My day ranges anywhere from meeting with clients, building project estimates to fixing bugs, building features or leading technical architecture for a client project.</p>\n<p>I first got into public speaking by presenting lightning talks at local technology meetups. I started by asking development questions, presenting about projects I was working on and demoing solutions I had built. <strong>As an introverted person I was nervous about getting in front of and speaking to a large group of people.</strong> I knew for myself and for progression in my career, public speaking was something I wanted to improve on.</p>\n<p>In 2013 I started submitting talks to conferences and forced myself into the deep-end.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LLmOZiu.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Submitting talks is a great excuse to learn something new.</strong> When I submit a talk proposal it’s usually on a topic that I am not an expert on, but one that I am interested in learning more about. I then have a motivator to deep dive into the topic to learn about it. This has the challenge of learning enough about a topic to be able to present it in a way that others can understand.</p>\n<p>For technical talks in particular, this means being able to break down the subject into basic terms and concepts. This practice has come in very helpful for my career and day job interacting with clients. Being able to explain technical issues or aspects of your project in simple ways is very helpful for improving communication abilities.</p>\n<p>More self-serving is the added benefit of being able to travel to different locations around the world to present talks. Most technical conferences will cover the ticket cost (and sometimes airfare and lodging) for speakers. This affords me the opportunity to visit places I may not be able to on my own and get introduced to new communities of people. The benefit to my career from this is that I’m able to grow my professional network. As well as, I have opportunities to listen to a large range of talks by other great speakers.</p>\n<p>Finally there is the benefit of building up my self confidence. <strong>The more I present the more confident I become in my abilities to do so.</strong> This has helped with my social anxiety and with my ability to interact with clients or potential clients. Thanks to my years of public speaking I am now not afraid to join in on conversations with little or no preparations and be confident in what I am going to say.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was in June 2013 at the conference Design 4 Drupal, hosted at MIT in Cambridge MA. I co-presented with a co-worker on responsive design in a talk titled “Bumps in the Road to Responsive”.</p>\n<p>As it was my first time speaking in front of a large group, I remember being very nervous about it. To prepare for the talk my co-presenter and I printed out scripts of exactly what we were going to say. Then we practiced many, many times, all the way up until the hour before our scheduled time slot. I do not remember much about presenting (it was all a blur), but we made it through it. People stayed through the whole thing and we had many follow up hallway conversations - which means attendees took away something helpful.</p>\n<p>My second time presenting and first time presenting solo, was in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-RQxA4JH6w\">April 2014 at a conference hosted at the UN building in New York City</a>. Again, I was very nervous about presenting and spent weeks rehearsing my talk. I had moved away from printing out a script and relied on having practiced my talk. That did not help my nerves and I remember hyperventilating, and my hands shaking. Yet I managed to get through it and covered all the points I wanted to talk about. I even managed to throw in a few (bad) jokes in my talk. At the end, I was very proud of what I accomplished and how I managed to present on my topic.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-RQxA4JH6w' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Mike Miles, “To Patch Contrib or Write a Custom Module”</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since 2013, I have applied to 40 different conferences a majority of which have been tech focused. Of those 40 I have spoken at 34 conferences, presenting 38 talks on 9 different subjects. This has given me a chance to present at conference in 4 different countries (US, Canada, Iceland &#x26; Germany). On average I build about 1 - 2 new technical topics a year, and present each at 5 - 6 different conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>After every presentation I take time reflect on how well I did and think of ways I can improve my process. This has lead to an evolution of a pre-talk routine that works for me.</p>\n<p>My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. <strong>I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I present my talk to a brick wall and yes it looks and feels awkward, but that is the point.</p>\n<p>I practice the way I’ll present the talk to work out the quirks and get the flow correct. By the time I’ve spent a week doing this, presenting my talk becomes muscle memory. I then do not have to worry about what I’m going to say and can instead focus on how I’m saying it. This allows me to react to any audience questions and manage my allotted time. This is the most important part of my pre-talk of my routine. After this time I DO NOT edit my presentation, doing so would only throw everything off.</p>\n<p>The day before and day of my talk I prepare my body. <strong>I start by making sure to get to bed at a respectable time and get a full night’s rest.</strong></p>\n<p>The morning of I have a good breakfast and if possible practice one last time. The hardest part of this phase is that I do not drink any coffee or caffeine leading up to my talk. <strong>I have found that since I still get nervous any caffeine over activates my nerves and leads to me speaking quickly and being shaky during my talk.</strong> I also use the day before / morning of to prepare backups of my presentation. I create a PDF version (that I can then share with the audience), back up to a cloud service, create a short link and if possible place it on a USB device. This way if anything catastrophic happens to my laptop or the internet goes down, I can still give my talk.</p>\n<p>The hour before my talk I spend clearing my mind. I’ll take a break from the conference I’m at, take a small walk and focus my mind on nothing. This time gives me a chance to calm down and relax. Fifteen minutes before my talk I find the room I’ll be presenting in (if I have not already done so) and sit in on the talk currently being given (if there is one).</p>\n<p>Then it’s time for me to get on stage, hook up my laptop and start talking!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you do not have to be an expert to present on a technical topic.</strong> Build a presentation around an interest. You do not have to be a subject matter expert and building a talk is a great motivator to learn something new.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>practice, practice, practice and practice out loud!</strong> You will not get a feel for your talk by practicing it “in your head”. Practice the way you present your talk. Standing up, hooked up to a monitor and not facing your slides. This allows you to build a muscle memory around what and how you are going to present.</p>\n<p>Third, when possible <strong>practice your talk in front of a trusted friend or family.</strong> Ideally someone who is not knowledgeable of the material. They will catch things about your presentation that you are not aware of and give you helpful feedback on the story you are telling. I cannot tell you the number of spelling and grammar mistakes my wife has found in my presentations.</p>\n<p>Fourth, <strong>do not be the person that edits your presentation hours/minutes leading up to your talk.</strong> Doing so means you are going to have to figure out what you want say while presenting. Losing the message / lesson you want to convey to your audience.</p>\n<p>Number five is <strong>do not be afraid to submit your talk to many conferences.</strong> You do not need to build a new talk for every CFP and the information you’ve built will be beneficial for many audiences. Plus the more times you give your talk the better you will become at it.</p>\n<p>Finally, number six, <strong>mistakes will happen and when they do move on.</strong> I’ve seen some technical talks derailed because the presenter spent too long trying to get a code example to work, or wait for a file to load due to a bad internet connection. If something is not going correct, move on to the next part of your talk, your audience will thank you.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers who I have looked up to and have inspired my career as a technical speaker. The first is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Crell\">Larry Garfield</a>. Larry outlined the methods he’s used to build technical talks and his guidelines. These have helped me numerous times to build session proposals that have been accepted by conferences. <a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">You can read Larry’s guidelines here</a>.</p>\n<p>The second speaker is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eaton\">Jeff Eaton</a>. Every time I have seen Jeff present, it is with enthusiasm and passion for what he is presenting on. As an attendee at one of his talks you feel this in the way he presents and you walk away feeling empowered (at least this has been my experience). The way Jeff Eaton presents is something I have striven to replicate in my own presentation style.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Interested readers can find out more about me in a number of different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can hear my voice monthly as the <a href=\"https://www.developingup.com\">host of the Developing Up podcast</a> - a podcast that is focused on the non-technical side of being a developer and growing a career in development.</li>\n<li>I can be found on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devuppodcast\">@devuppodcast</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemiles86\">@mikemiles86</a>.</li>\n<li>All of my previous technical talks and upcoming speaking engagements can be found on my website at <a href=\"http://www.mike-miles.com\">www.mike-miles.com</a>.</li>\n<li>And I’m always happy to connect on LinkedIn at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/\">linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Mike Miles, Podcaster Focused on the Nontechnical Side of Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-mike-miles/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/16","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aiVLNLBPbgjq_2LlEvHL4MzyfKpIB_DT"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

I’ve been involved in public speaking throughout my life, especially when I was younger.</p>\n<p>Recently, I felt a call to pick it up again for many reasons but one in particular: design and development teams must change their approach to words online. Many, many organizations (including those that should know better) still write their online content the same way they would for traditional media. That approach drags down their product’s user experience, makes it harder for customers to engage with them online, and has a large negative impact on the success of their digital products. I set out to speak out about this widespread problem and how we should fix it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l6UnYFz.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I’m still pretty new on the conference scene but even so, <strong>I’ve already made a lot of connections with both people in my field and those outside of it.</strong> I think it’s a lot easier to meet people when you’re the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time – a real plus for an introvert like me.</p>\n<p>Also, I’ve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places – I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It went well! I think I was surprised when I found out that people do actually care a great deal about their digital content and want to know how to make it better and more usable. The audience had a ton of questions, which was great. The whole thing is kind of addicting. You experience it once and think, “I want to do that again.”</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve spoken at about ten events so far with another four or five already scheduled for later this year.</p>\n<p>I’ve applied to a lot more than that for sure. I probably send out three applications a month and that number has been growing lately. But <strong>the more I apply and the more I speak, the more conferences are approaching me instead of the other way around and that’s a really nice feeling.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATVKZdl_pEw?start=130' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Bailey Lewis at OKC Design Tech</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I always try to see the space before I speak in it. That could mean swinging by the room before my presentation or trying to find a video of a presentation someone else gave in that room online. Seeing the space before my presentation lets me decide where to stand and helps me understand how the audience will be looking at my slides (one big screen? multiple screens around the room? etc).</p>\n<p>Other than that, <strong>I take a deep breath and remind myself: The audience came to see me present on this topic.</strong> They want it to go well as much as I do. And that’s a lot more helpful than imagining them in their underwear.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>If you’re brand new, it might be hard to find speaking gigs that will cover your travel and accommodations. The conference might even ask you to pay to attend even though you’re speaking (not my favorite practice but there you have it).</p>\n<p>Take a few of these gigs if you need to so you can get started and get your name out there, but as soon as someone offers to cover your travel/accommodations, demand it every time you speak afterward. Even better if you can throw a speaker stipend into the mix. That will probably mean saying no to conferences you’d really like to speak at, which can be painful. But once you reach certain level in your speaking career, you shouldn’t be digging in your own pockets when you’re the one providing the presentation content that will sell conference tickets and make the event successful.</p>\n<p>By the way, <strong>I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.</strong></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’m not sure about specific conference speakers (although there are presentations I’ve really enjoyed), but my father is a trial attorney and, among other speaking-related lessons, he taught me the art of giving a presentation without swaying or fidgeting. He would record me giving a presentation and then have me watch it back – it was extremely effective for getting rid of the fidgets.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Find me at <a href=\"https://truematter.com/baileylewis\">truematter.com/baileylewis</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>When I was in college, I was paralyzed by the fear of public speaking. Just the thought of talking in front of a small class would cause cold-sweats. Fortunately, I was studying for a career in Comp Sci. which usually doesn’t require much public speaking.</p>\n<p>Once my career began, I was reaffirmed, no one wants to hear a developer speak. That was fine for a few years, and then new nagging energy began. People can’t listen if you don’t speak. Quietly interjecting important points without ever taking the lead of a conversation is less effective than not speaking at all. It was time to start breaking out of my shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Though I was uncomfortable, I started speaking up more and more.</strong> I attended conferences, and I marveled at speakers. I was amazed, but sure I would never be on the other side of the 4th wall.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can’t shut me up. It’s always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn’t comfortable, but it’s doable. Now <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">you can see I’ve been speaking actively for years</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m very fortunate that I work for the great people at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a> who have supported me from lightning talk to keynote speaker.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>The best thing about speaking at conferences is the networking and connection. I’ve made friends around the world.</strong> This has, directly AND indirectly, benefited my career and employer. It’s not required in my job description, but it’s valuable to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>There’s something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts. I’m still an introvert, but it doesn’t matter who you are, something like that feels great. The community and positivity of it all is superb!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>After a lot of Toastmasters, and speaking at a local meetup, my first “conference” talk was a lightning slot at RubyConf 2013.</p>\n<p>How’d it go? Well, my heart was beating through my chest. But I gave a 30-minute presentation in 5 minutes after getting over my fear of public speaking, so there was no way to fail :)</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJOkpP__dY4?start=4829' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Gant Laborde at RubyConf, 2013</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>50+ and no stopping in sight!</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XfgC3IW.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde/status/1107007420763639808\">general rules for sure</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No dairy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\">Power Pose</a></li>\n<li>Think more about your audience than yourself</li>\n<li>Realize the audience wants you to succeed, and they can’t see that you’re nervous unless you tell them.</li>\n<li>They will feel what you feel. So 😃 (smile)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You’re not done and you’re not stuck. <strong>For a lot of people, level 1 was just speaking. Then it’s to speak well. Then it’s to fill a room, then get invited to speak, then keynote.</strong> The best speakers are people who have been leveling up for 20+ years, and they support and promote speakers who are just getting started. It’s not a zero-sum game, ask for help, get feedback, and improve. Then repeat. The best speakers aren’t born speakers.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I LOVE TED TALKS! <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gantlaborde/5-ted-talks-that-changed-me-4aa0cec43d79\">Here’s 5 that have made me recontextualize life</a>.</p>\n<p>As for Tech, I’d say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jevakallio\">Jani Evakallio</a> has been amazing every talk I see.
