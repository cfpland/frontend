At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>I find the most interesting people are those who are passionate and devoted to a cause. Drishti is both of those things. Besides being a computer engineer and speaker, Drishti runs a non-profit in India that has already impacted 10 cities, and gotten Drishti attention in her state.</p>\n<p>While this would be impressive enough, Drishti also uses her talent for public speaking to inspire and help others learn more about technology - something that many speakers can likely identify with. I‚Äôm thrilled to bring you Drishti‚Äôs story today, and hope it inspires you to get out and do some good in the world!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w36pjbN.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I am Drishti Jain a Computer Engineer at heart and a technology enthusiast. I love to use technology to help the less fortunate. I am a social entrepreneur. I am the Co-founder and President of the non-profit organisation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samyakdrishtifoundation\">Samyak Drishti Foundation</a> which works in environment, education and healthcare sectors in 10 cities across India. I have been titled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoptimistcitizen/p/BdT0mVJnMhU/\">Eco-Warrior thrice by the Government of Maharashtra, India</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been a good orator since a young age. I got into public speaking at school in grade 4; when I had to give a speech on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (for his birth anniversary). Ever since, I‚Äôve loved the stage and sharing knowledge with all. Fun Fact: I also host music concerts sometimes :)</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences about things that I am passionate about. While I continue to learn new things and develop myself, I like to share my learning with others. Speaking at conferences, I am sharing with everyone about how cool a technology is or how I make the most of a feature. It gives me immense satisfaction to share my knowledge with all.</p>\n<p>I have learnt a lot speaking at conferences. I would like to share my secret weapon to effectively speaking in front large audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>My secret weapon ‚Äì the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause.</strong> These are three key parts of speaking effectively at conferences. Using this paradigm, I am able to more effectively deliver my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Moreover, speaking at conferences I am able to share my learning with all and give them a head start in the technology. I am believer of ‚ÄúLearning by sharing Knowledge‚Äù and speaking at conferences just fuels that!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was an exciting experience. Post deciding my topic (after a lot of brainstorming) I realized that I had just entered the long hiking trail of preparing my talk, yet to embark. There was a mountain of information I had gathered through research on the topic. And I had to create my talk in a way that I would cover maximum information and make it interesting. <strong>It all seemed overwhelming at first; but I decide to sit and create a summary of the information, that made it easy to prepare my talk.</strong></p>\n<p>On the day of the conference, I reached the venue early and checked if my laptop was compatible with the system; it was all ok and I was set to present my talk. Having reached early, I got comfortable with the environment and eagerly waited for my talk slot.</p>\n<p>I gave my talk and had a good Q and A for my talk; which gave me the assurance and satisfaction that I presented well and attendees were listening keenly.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing experience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Considering events, workshops, tech talks, conferences I have spoken at about 30-40; including a few virtual speaking engagements.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I attend the talk before my talk to set into the energy of the conference hall. <strong>I also do a demo practice with a friend to gain feedback.</strong></p>\n<p>I feel enthusiastic over nervous before my talk. I believe I have learned to convert my nervous energy into enthusiasm by practicing before my talk. I know it can be difficult due to packed schedules of the conference and work; but I do make sure to make time to practice. Sometimes I skim through my talk contents or rehearse the complete talk depending on the time I can make in my schedule.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I will encourage new speakers to speak about what they are truly passionate about. <strong>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present.</strong> It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!</p>\n<p>If you feel crunching everything you love about the topic into the 30/45 min talk is getting on to you, <strong>go outside and have fresh air. It will help you have a clear head and invoke creativity in your talk.</strong> It is very trivial to know the audience you will be presenting for. Most importantly remember to be yourself and be excited to share with the world what you like about the technology.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I got inspired by the talk by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pranavmistry\">Pranav Mistry</a> on the Sixth-Sense technology. I liked how he presented the technology and included components in the talk that could be understood by someone new in the technology space. It has inspired me to include an overview of concepts related to my topic in the beginning of my talk for a couple of minutes, so that a participant novice to the topic understands the overall picture and doesn‚Äôt feel left out.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrtANPtnhyg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>TEDIndia: The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology by Pranav Mistry</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am active on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drishtijjain\">@drishtijjain</a>.

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Kara Luton‚Äôs path from ballerina to public relations to software engineer may be unusual, but with more software developers coming from non-traditional backgrounds, it‚Äôs not as surprising as it used to be. What‚Äôs impressive to me is how quickly Kara has embraced her new career and been able to help others by giving talks at conferences and meetups. As Kara points out in this week‚Äôs Speaker‚Äôs Story, speaking is a great way to bolster your career and encourage others in the field.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into tech and eventually public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zFT1aBg.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I had a weird path to tech. I pursued a career as a professional ballerina for a long time. I even moved to New York City by myself at 17 to train full-time with the Joffrey Ballet School. I really loved ballet but I realized that I‚Äôd be lucky if I could make my career last until I was 30 due to all of the strain it puts on your body.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs when I decided to take a break from ballet, move back to my hometown of Nashville, TN, and go to college. I majored in public relations with a music business minor and was one of the lucky few to land a job in the music industry after I graduated.</p>\n<p>I absolutely loved working as a music publicist. It was a very glamorous job but also a highly stressful one and I was getting burnt out pretty quickly. I knew I needed a change and started looking into other career paths when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">CodeCademy</a>. I really enjoyed the feeling of solving an error and decided that I wanted to make the leap to tech so I enrolled in The Iron Yard‚Äôs front end engineering bootcamp. Fast forward almost three years later and I‚Äôm still loving life in the tech world. I‚Äôm currently working as an engineer on the UX team at <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\">CrowdStrike</a>.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely benefited my career. It‚Äôs allowed me to expand my network in ways that I‚Äôve never imagined before!</p>\n<p>I got into conference speaking first by writing blog posts which eventually led to speaking at local meetups and then conferences. I like that by speaking at conferences I can help others learn. <strong>It‚Äôs really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I‚Äôm talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn‚Äôt before.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I gave my first conference talk not too long ago! Big shout out to CodeStock for allowing me the opportunity. I‚Äôm really happy with the way my talk turned out. I talk fast naturally and talk even faster when I‚Äôm nervous so I was worried that my 60-minute time slot would end up being closer to 20 minutes. I took my time and a couple deep breaths and managed to use up most of my allotted time though!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm still pretty new to the speaker circuit so I‚Äôve only applied to around eight conferences. I‚Äôve spoken at one so far and am currently on the waitlist for another. <strong>I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. I‚Äôm learning from each rejection I get.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt like to attend a session before my talk as I like to take that time to be by myself and compose my thoughts. I‚Äôll typically run through my slides one last time but I‚Äôll only do a visual run through - I won‚Äôt actually practice. I also like to take a minute or two to go somewhere on my own and give myself a little pep talk!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Go for it! You can never succeed if you don‚Äôt try.</strong> Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and don‚Äôt give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really love watching Chloe Condon‚Äôs talks. I love how she injects humor into them.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n3GHyWTaM8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Chloe Condon at DevXcon, 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>As a freelance developer, it can be hard to justify the time and energy required to speak at conferences, but for George Mandis, the experience is well worth it. Like many speakers, George is an experienced software developer who‚Äôs passionate about mentoring and teaching newcomers to the field. In this week‚Äôs interview, hear more about how speaking at over 20 conferences so far has helped take George‚Äôs career to the next level.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://georgemandis.s3.amazonaws.com/holyjs-piter-2017/me-holy-js.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">George Mandis</a>. I‚Äôm currently a full stack, independent web developer at <a href=\"https://snaptortoise.com/\">SnapTortoise</a> based out of Portland, Oregon, though I wear quite a few other hats. I‚Äôve been freelancing for 13 years, but over the past 4 or 5 years I‚Äôve gravitated towards mentorship roles. Teaching classes, workshops, leading bootcamps and working with junior developers one-on-one has been a rewarding experience and speaking feels like a natural extension to this.</p>\n<p>My first foray into speaking was actually at an Ignite event in Portland where I summarized, in 5 minutes, my experience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2QC43jwPyM\">living as a digital nomad</a> for a year. I was terrified to speak in front of so many people, but it went well! After that I though I should look into conference speaking as a way to advance myself professionally, extend the aforementioned mentoring activities I mentioned and continue to travel and see the world, which is one my biggest passions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2QC43jwPyM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things ‚Äî not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!</strong></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs always interesting to me to see one type of work or technology in-demand in one place and find it barely mentioned at all in another. It‚Äôs also nice to humanize other developers and put a face and a personality to a name. These conferences also have a tendency to be expensive and difficult to otherwise attend, as an independent developer. Being able to attend these conferences and pick the brain of people who work at some very large, influential tech companies is a wonderful opportunity.</p>\n<p>I think the process of preparing a talk and speaking in front of a large group people could benefit anyone‚Äôs career, but for mine it‚Äôs certainly opened some doors. <strong>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.</strong></p>\n<p>The other benefit of speaking is I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a great opportunity to talk about the things you want to be doing, even if it‚Äôs not the thing you‚Äôre necessarily doing in your day-to-day. My talks tend to focus on creativity, art, hardware-dabbling and making interesting, outside-the-box projects through JavaScript. Speaking on these topics has allowed me to spend more time immersed in that world and meet other like-minded and very talented people with similar interests.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My very first ‚Äútalk‚Äù was the 5-minute Ignite talk I mentioned earlier, but my first <em>technical</em> talk was at HolyJS in Russia. I remember applying to a number of conferences by that point in the year. Some had accepted me but had no budget for travel, but HolyJS was the first one where everything lined up.</p>\n<p>The idea of talking for a full hour was incredibly daunting ‚Äî I‚Äôd never done that before! When I pulled up the conference website I became even more nervous ‚Äî David Crockford and Lea Verou were two developers I‚Äôd read and followed for most of my career, and they were head-lining the conference! My attitude going in was, <strong>if this goes terribly, at least I‚Äôm 2000 miles from home and probably won‚Äôt ever run into any of these people again.</strong> It sounds funny, but it really took the pressure off!</p>\n<p>Fortunately it went well, and I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôve seen several familiar faces from that conference at other conferences since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure I could put a number on the number I‚Äôve applied to. I‚Äôve spoken at something around 20 now, but can guarantee you <strong>my acceptance rate is in the single digits, percentage-wise.</strong> Like most opportunities, it really is a numbers game. You have to be diligent and persistent, but also mindful of how you might be able to tweak your proposals to better suit a particular conference‚Äôs theme.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>If I have time a day or two before the conference <strong>I like to walk to the venue from wherever I‚Äôm staying so that I‚Äôm not thinking too hard about finding it on the day I present.</strong> In the hours leading up to the presentation I practice saying key sentences and takeaways for specific slides as I go through the slide from beginning to end, over and over, and make sure all my demos work. Once it‚Äôs about 30-minutes or so to go I‚Äôll put the slides away and just try to clear my head. This routine changes depending on how new the talk is and how comfortable I‚Äôm feeling with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I also try to see as many other talks as I can</strong>, though I that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming. After I‚Äôve given my talk I‚Äôm much more relaxed and find it easier to enjoy the other talks. I try to make a point of shaking hands with all the speakers I see and letting them know I really appreciated what they spoke on. Other speakers might have differing opinions on that, but I know I genuinely appreciate it when someone in the audience comes up to me just to let me know they enjoyed my talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>When it comes to applying <strong>it really is a numbers game.</strong></p>\n<p>Apply early and often and try not to get too down on yourself if your talk isn‚Äôt accepted. For topics, there are many schools of thought on this, but I personally feel sharing a case study or story about how you used a particular piece of technology to achieve a specific goal is a good approach for giving your talk structure. Talking about why technology X is cool in general way can be just fine, but sharing how we used X at Y to achieve Z gives the audience something more concrete to walk away with.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre giving a workshop you can dive more deeply into the nitty-gritty workings of a thing and keep your focus there, but in a 20-40 minutes talk it‚Äôs more about introducing an idea and making the case for why others should have interest in it.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are quite a few, but I‚Äôll mention two people I met at my very first talk who I think are wonderful: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/g33konaut\">Martin Splitt</a>. The list could be much longer, but I‚Äôll stick with those for fear of omitting someone! I feel both of them have real passion for the web as an open platform and convey their enthusiasm and knowledge very well when they speak.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>Next, I‚Äôll be giving a talk called <a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2019\">‚ÄúHacking Hardware with JavaScript‚Äù at Teardown 2019 in
