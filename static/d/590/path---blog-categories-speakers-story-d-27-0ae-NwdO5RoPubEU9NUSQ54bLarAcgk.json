I really enjoy learning from and trading stories with other speakers, so I‚Äôm excited to bring his story to life here on the blog. Like many speakers I‚Äôve interviewed, Scott started off reluctant to get on stage, but has turned one of his biggest weaknesses into an indispensable strength.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"/img/posts/scott-asai.jpeg\" class=\"right\" />\n<p>Up until a few years ago I used to fear public speaking. As an introvert, it was something I avoided throughout high school and college. But one day I realized the reason I was scared was because I let the negative self-talk get into my head. Once I shifted the talk to ‚ÄúI want to be a great speaker‚Äù everything started to change.</p>\n<p>Recently, I made the transition from coaching to speaking full-time because every time I spoke it produced more speaking opportunities and coaching clients. Deep down I love a challenge. Doing something that I viewed as a weakness and turning it into a strength is exhilarating.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like to connect with people individually while I speak on stage. I treat it like coaching, but instead of connecting with one person it‚Äôs many at once. I enjoy sharing information on topics I am passionate about. If I can make the content fun and useful it feels like I‚Äôm helping people.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>Soft Skills. I‚Äôve always loved leadership, but I tried to niche down to soft skills. Hard skills are more marketable, but soft skills are what get your promoted and remembered.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt. I think when I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to speak I may have blanked it out of my mind. I don‚Äôt think I was terrible, but it wasn‚Äôt something I looked forward to at the time.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôd say in the hundreds. Most of them have come in the past year, but I‚Äôve definitely applied to a lot over my career.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/74S8h3BpBPs' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74S8h3BpBPs\">Saving Soft Skills From Extinction</a>‚Äù by Scott Asai at TEDxLaie</em></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Practice more. All the resources in the world don‚Äôt compare to getting on stage and speaking. You‚Äôll make mistakes. It‚Äôs part of growth. Just give yourself more opportunities to get better. Lastly, at some point you have to watch recordings of yourself. As cringeworthy as it may be, it will make you better. No one is a harsher critic of you than you are.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>I really respect <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonsinek\">Simon Sinek</a>. His talk <em>Start with Why</em> is what I go back to when I think of speaking. He‚Äôs also introverted which helps me relate to him. But it feels like he gets in a zone when he‚Äôs speaking.

Kirk Pepperdine sold the company he founded\nto Microsoft, and now helps build the Java experience for Azure.</p>\n<p>Kirk has spoken at countless conferences (as evidenced by his trove of event badges), and is currently talking about performance\ntuning for Java.

Read on for more of Kirk‚Äôs story.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your job and how did you get into speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PzxbxD-GRJu4Z3fp-tV5whC-y6POyS9D\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a principle engineer at Microsoft. This all came about as a result of Microsoft acquiring jClarity, a small performance tooling company that I co-founded. Microsoft was looking to build a team of Java experts to help them create the best experience possible for Java in Azure. Plus, Microsoft owns a surprising number of Java assets so adding more Java expertise makes sense. I‚Äôm very humbled to be part of a groundbreaking team inside Microsoft. Right now we‚Äôre tuning a number of internal applications as well as continuing to build out performance diagnostic tooling that we were developing at jClarity.</p>\n<p>As for side projects, I‚Äôm picking at a few ideas in the performance tooling and diagnostic space at the moment. Difficult to say what will see the light of day at the moment but I expect at least one of them will be released sometime this year.</p>\n<p>And there is always <a href=\"https://www.jcrete.org/\">jCrete</a>, an unconference that I cofounded with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heinzkabutz\">Dr. Heinz Kabutz</a>. I don‚Äôt know how, but we‚Äôve managed to create an environment that has attracted a significant number of the most notable names in the Java space. It‚Äôs been very satisfying to watch people come to jCrete, be inspired by the incredible amount of talent and then take that energy and create things with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jitwatch\">JITWatch</a> is an amazing tool that was inspired by Chris Newland‚Äôs understanding of some of the compiler people that he was speaking to. Even more satisfying was watching some of the kids who were tagging along with mum or dad to the conference gain interest in what was going on to the point where they‚Äôd start participating. At least one of the kids took the ideas from jCrete back to her high school and setup an unconference there for a completely un-IT subject.</p>\n<p>That brings me back to the point, when we invite a person to attend jCrete, we don‚Äôt only invite the person, we have invited his or her‚Äôs family or partner whom are perfectly accepted to attend sessions. In a few cases we‚Äôve had spouses and partners propose and lead sessions on topics related to their profession that has relevance to our everyday lives. Having spouses, partners, kids all about creates an amazing atmosphere which is surprisingly beneficial for learning and sharing experiences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like sharing knowledge. To have the chance to share something that may help make a developers life easier or help them better understand how something works is very fulfilling. It‚Äôs also a great time to connect with people, attendees and other speakers to talk tech, toss around ideas, and see the progress others have made on their pet projects.</p>\n<h3>What makes Java performance tuning such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, early on in my career I was not interested performance tuning. I just became the ‚Äúgoto‚Äù guy because I was perceived as having some knack of seeing the source of performance problems and so people kept coming to me when they had issues and I just kept solving them.</p>\n<p>This is how I came to work with Jack Shirazi. We were working together on a project in a bank and after a disastrous false start, management came to Jack and myself and assigned us the glorious task of tuning it. Jack took the experience and our notes to write Java Performance Tuning which was a perennial best seller for O‚ÄôReilly for the longest time. Jack then started <a href=\"http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/\">the companion site (www.javaperformancetuning.com)</a> where I helped him launch. Afterwards we worked together to get the first version of a performance tuning workshop together and before we were ready, people started asking for it. After launch I continued on with the workshop and it‚Äôs been a living work in progress ever since.</p>\n<p>A big part of maintaining and evolving the workshop has been, how can I better describe this point so that I can get a better success rate when people try it out on life like problems.</p>\n<p>From this and my consulting practice I eventually formed the seals of a performance diagnostic process. This immediately had an effect on attendees. I had a tuning exercise that took a couple of hours each day over the 4 days to work through. After I introduced the methodology I started seeing attendees complete the entire exercise in 2 to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing productivity boost. Even better were the emails I‚Äôd get after the workshop ended. People were telling me that they were able to solve long standing nagging problems in minutes. It‚Äôs funny but when people try to customize the workshop for their own companies ‚Äúspecial‚Äù needs they almost always want do drop the methodology section. I never let them do that. It is my opinion that the methodology is the <em>most</em> important topic of the workshop and the final exercises are there just to deepen the understanding of that process.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm not going to claim that my methodology is a silver bullet and there isn‚Äôt any other way to tune. Certainly there are others in the industry such as Branden Gregg that has a well thought out methodology. And of course there are others such as Heinz Kabutz, Peter Lawrey, Martin Thompson, Charlie Hunt, Monica Beckwith, Todd Montgomery, Cliff Click, Gil Tene and of course Jack Shirazi and others that I‚Äôve taken inspiration from that have a lot to say on the subject.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at one of the first Devoxx. Jack and I had a two hour session. I remember the room was pretty big and pretty full. <strong>I remember being very nervous about the entire thing and I was very happy when it was over.</strong> I remember the immediate feedback was friendly but I‚Äôd have to say that the materials have matured considerably since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve no idea as I‚Äôve completely lost track. I did keep all of the conference badges. Here‚Äôs a picture of some of them:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1slhdy-kQPgrV7SKJ3P8NdxjTc32eis5V\" alt=\"Conference Badges\"></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Good question, I guess I do. After getting wired up‚Ä¶If there is someone in the audience that I know I‚Äôll sit with them and just talk about nothing in particular. Otherwise I generally just try to clear my mind and relax.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>We generally always have a a session at <a href=\"https://www.jcrete.org/\">jCrete</a> about becoming a better speaker.</p>\n<p>From the years of attending these the common conclusion is <strong>people like stories, they like to be entertained and most importantly they are there to learn something that is relevant to their day to day existence as a developer.</strong> If you can combine all of these elements into a talk then you‚Äôre generally going to be well received and the talk will be memorable.</p>\n<p>For effects, I use diagrams in favor of words, single words instead of walls of text, blank slides when the audience should be focusing on your voice and not be distracted reading a wall of text. When you believe your slide deck is finished, that is the time to start thinking about presentation and how the material fits onto the slides and what can be done to improve the visual aspects of the talk. In my experience, Audiences tend to respond well to desks that say, I cared enough to take the extra time to make this visual appealing.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There is a long list of speakers that I look up to for many different reasons. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heinzkabutz\">Dr. Heinz Kabutz</a> for his mastery of his subject matter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Dr. Venkat Subramaniam</a> for his ability to take an audience on amazing journeys, Adam Bien one of the original live coders, Josh Long, amazing energy and his ability to project it onto the audience, Ted Neward, Cameron Prudy, and the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://gotochgo.com/2020/speakers/1323/kirk-pepperdine\">Kirk Pepperdine and his upcoming talk at GOTO Chicago here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

What‚Äôs your job and how did you get into speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1G9YoZUE9RJzUMGKuzwOhqW82nek6qNsj\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Phil Nash and I am a Developer Evangelist for <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com\">Twilio</a>. I like working with Ruby, JavaScript and anything on the web platform. As an evangelist I spend my days working on example applications, building tools to help developers, and on writing blog posts, documentation and talks.</p>\n<p>Before evangelism I worked as a developer in London in an agency and product studio called <a href=\"https://mintdigital.com/\">Mint Digital</a>, which gave me the chance to work across a number of different styles of project. That was also where I was encouraged to get into public speaking, the company had a great policy that let us attend 2 conferences a year and would support us for more if we got accepted to speak. I seized that opportunity and it led to a few speaking engagements in European conferences, and eventually to this role in evangelism.</p>\n<p>On the side I like <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/\">blogging on my own site</a> and maintaining <a href=\"https://github.com/philnash?tab=repositories\">a bunch of open source applications, rubygems and node modules</a>. I‚Äôm also a Google Developer Expert, a <a href=\"https://untappd.com/user/philnash\">lover of beer</a> and now living in Melbourne, Australia.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has absolutely had a direct benefit to my career, it is part of my career now, but that doesn‚Äôt stop it being fun too. Something I realised as I started my evangelism career was that <strong>I enjoy speaking because I enjoy teaching people, showing them new things or new ways to achieve something</strong>. Breaking down topics, giving them my spin and hopefully making it entertaining along the way has become a passion.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs what I love about the speaking side of things, but attending conferences in general has led to meeting so many kind, intelligent, community minded people that the best part of speaking is being able to do this more. Anyone can go to a conference and meet people, but if you speak it becomes a lot easier. Most people get a lot out of conferences because they get to listen to and learn from the experiences of those on stage. The real benefits lie in making connections with and learning from the experiences of as many people in the audience too.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I love talking about advancing the web platform. When I got into development professionally the number of features we had available to us to build experiences on the web were very few. The power of things like WebRTC, service workers, speech recognition and push notifications expand the amazing things we can build on the web. I like to experiment with these features and hopefully inspire others to use them in new and interesting ways.</p>\n<p>I also like picking up things that aren‚Äôt well understood and going in a bit deeper on them. I did this for two factor authentication, initially wanting to find out exactly how a website and a mobile app could agree on a 6 digit code, and building that into an experience.</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>I just like talking about things I‚Äôve worked on. They tend to be things I‚Äôm passionate about and while the audience may learn about that particular project</strong>, I hope they also take away things they can use in their own projects too.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>It seems that my first conference talk is now confined to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160809165416/http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2012/talks/html5-takes-over-the-world\">the Wayback Machine</a>. It was a talk called ‚ÄúHTML5 takes over the world‚Äù and was about all the fancy new features of the web back in 2012, including an experimental build of the Opera browser that had the first implementation of <code class=\"language-text\">getUserMedia</code> for getting access to a user‚Äôs camera and microphone.</p>\n<p>I remember being very nervous and drinking 3 cups of coffee before getting on stage. <strong>I had a half hour slot for the talk and I stormed through the talk, I think I finished in around 17 minutes and out of breath.</strong> I remember being happy with what I said, but a bit taken aback by the performance itself. At least we had plenty of time for questions.</p>\n<p>To this day I won‚Äôt have more than one cup of coffee before getting on stage in case I set myself speaking at double speed again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>After a quick count through my <a href=\"https://philna.sh/speaking/history\">speaking history</a>, it looks as though I‚Äôve spoken at between 70 and 80 conferences since 2012. I‚Äôve applied to so many more though, it‚Äôs not even funny. <strong>I must have sent in hundreds of proposals and been rejected hundreds of times too.</strong></p>\n<p>I‚Äôve learned not to take that to heart as each conference organiser or CFP committee member has a different view on the talks they want to see at their event. <strong>A talk may be wrong for once conference and right for another</strong>, which is why it is worth finding the open CFPs and finding the right conference for your talk.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I think my pre-talk routine mostly consists of pacing around and going through the talk in my head. And not drinking too much coffee.</p>\n<p>I still get nervous before crowds, particularly if it‚Äôs the first outing of a talk. I don‚Äôt think that will ever go away fully, so I embrace it. I don‚Äôt have rituals or anything that makes it better so I just try to use the nervous energy to my advantage.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Every person that gets on a stage to give a talk to an audience is up there telling their story and if you want to give a talk on something you need to find your angle on it. When you include your experiences it makes your talk unique. <strong>I could happily watch presentations on the same piece of code by 10 different people because I bet I would learn something new from each of them.</strong> You are the world‚Äôs foremost expert on your own experiences, and I believe that needs to come across in your presentation. That way you can‚Äôt be an imposter because no-one else has had your experience.</p>\n<p>When it comes to finding conferences to apply to, I recently wrote up a <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/2020/01/29/how-to-find-cfps-for-developer-conferences/\">list of different sites and mailing lists you can use to keep up to date with open CFPs</a> (including <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a> of course).</p>\n<p><strong>The most important thing for giving talks is to practice, out loud.</strong> You don‚Äôt need to have an audience to practice to, but running through the slides and saying the words you want to say out loud will stick them in your head much better for when you come to say them in front of other people. Nothing can substitute rehearsal for ensuring you are prepared when it comes time to speak.</p>\n<p>If you are speaking at a conference, I‚Äôd recommend giving your talk to a local meet-up first too. That way you can get a good gauge on what the audience thinks of it, anything useful you might have missed and what the questions might be. It also forces you to practice at least once before you get to the conference.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Oh so many people. I‚Äôve been fortunate to have been at so many conferences and seen so many speakers that I have inspiration all around. I already know I‚Äôm forgetting so many people as I write this following list, but here‚Äôs some fantastic people off the top of my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All my fellow (and former) developer evangelist colleagues at Twilio, they both inspire me and also challenge me to improve all the time</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie\">Charlie Gerard</a> for her amazing side projects leading to AI and web powered live demos</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> for her ability to break down the most complicated parts of CSS and make anyone understand</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tenderlove\">Aaron Patterson</a> for taking the deepest of dives into how Ruby works but doing so in a flurry of puns</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/erinjzimmer\">Erin Zimmer</a> for digging into browsers, Angular and web components and making them accessible to all</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And many, many more.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers</h3>\n<p>You can find me almost anywhere on the internet as <em>philnash</em>, from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philnash\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/philnash\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/philnash/\">LinkedIn</a> to my own site, <a href=\"https://philna.sh\">philna.sh</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm also streaming <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/phil_nash/\">live coding on Twitch frequently</a>, so come say ‚ÄúHi! üëã‚Äù sometime!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

Berkeley, called <a href=\"https://anyscale.io/\">Anyscale</a>. We‚Äôre developing the open-source <a href=\"https://ray.io/\">Ray</a> system for distribution of Python tasks from single machines to clusters, specifically to optimize compute scenarios in reinforcement learning, hyper parameter tuning, model serving, and other compute-intensive Python applications.</p>\n<p>I started speaking at conferences over a decade ago when I first did consulting. I‚Äôve worked in a range of roles, from engineer to VP-level management, to evangelism, and in different industries, from embedded systems and medical electronics to Internet and Big Data startups.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I enjoy public speaking, defining and delivering the arc of a story about a particular software development. I also show off my personal photography in my slides. ;)</p>\n<p><strong>It has been a huge boost to my career, both for establishing name recognition and expertise in the areas I‚Äôve worked, as well the useful things you learn meeting a diverse range of people facing a broad list of challenges.</strong> It has been an important part of my job for most of the last 15 years or so.</p>\n<h3>What makes scaling distributed systems (and Ray in particular) such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>What attracted me to Ray is the thought that went into its design to provide a very accessible API for developers, which is easy to use, yet frees the developer from having to understand a lot of details about distributed systems. Behind that API is a very performant implementation that scales extremely well for a variety of workloads. I‚Äôm also very interested in ML approaches like reinforcement learning, so I‚Äôm learning a lot about them, as well.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>It was ‚ÄúPanel on the future of Aspect Oriented Programming‚Äù (with a few other speakers) at JBossTwo Conference, June 2003, San Francisco. I think it was recorded, but I believe it‚Äôs long since disappeared.

I‚Äôm really glad Danielle Pollard - a fellow Chicagoan - got back to me to share\nher story.</p>\n<p>In addition to her professional work as an Agile Lead, Danielle has a passion for lifting up those in the community\nwho most need help. While she‚Äôs relatively new at speaking at conferences, Danielle has been winning speaking competitions\nsince grade school, so read on to hear some of her candid and helpful advice.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself.</h3>\n<img alt=\"Danielle Pollard photo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1fPEc4sWvfbW3_Gu2gkuu5nhfr9ki_4l0\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm currently an Agile Coach for Spot Hero in Chicago. SpotHero is a digital parking reservation service that connects drivers looking to reserve and pay for parking spaces with parking lots, parking garages and valet services.</p>\n<p>I believe that trust is hands down the #1 force multiplier for high performance, and I‚Äôve used that belief to create results as a project management consultant and Lean/Agile transformation coach for best in class companies like UPS, Kohler, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Yellow-Roadway, RR Donnelley, Allstate, Apartments.com, US Foods.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm also working closely with <a href=\"http://fchnwecare.com/\">FCHN</a>, a Soup Kitchen on the south side of Chicago focused on feeding, clothing and helping the needy. FCHN has been serving the community with hot meals 6 days a week for over 32 years. They are struggling to keep the lights on and I‚Äôm determined to turn things around for them.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been able to impact the lives of hundreds of inner city youth and aspiring women entrepreneurs through nonprofits I work with, and in my non-existent ‚Äúspare time‚Äù you can find me reading, eating some juicy carnivorous meal (scotch included) or being a personal barber for my two boys.</p>\n<h3>How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>In 4th grade my teacher was fed-up with my antics and inability to remain quiet and stay in my seat during class so she encouraged me to participate in the upcoming Speech Contest. I did. I won. And won and won and won until I became the 2nd Place winner in the Chicago-Wide Oratory competition.</p>\n<p>Never looked back.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences because I get a chance to meet some pretty awesome like-minded professionals, learn from them and share my ideas. Mostly for the love of helping and inspiring others and that has definitely enhanced my work as an Agile Coach without a doubt!</p>\n<h3>What makes Agile team leadership such an interesting topic to you?</h3>\n<p>It‚Äôs exciting for me because I love building resilient and learning teams that are able to handle anything that comes their way with top notch skill, professionalism and an unwavering focus on delivering value to both the business and the customer. Change is the only constant and I help teams and companies embrace and leverage it as a competitive advantage.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It was for the Agile Professional Learning Network‚Äôs annual conference. It went a whole lot better than I thought. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but I showed up and did my best and people seemed to like that.</p>\n<p>What I remember most is that my mom came and sat right in the front. She was supposed to record it for me but ended up getting so caught up in the presentation she completely forgot.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine includes prayer and for some reason I always get one more brilliant idea that I try to add in at the last minute‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs about.</p>\n<p><strong>I also use lots of positive self-talk because I get extremely nervous.</strong> I remind myself to focus on the message and not me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I can give is just sharing four things that I always try to remember for myself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A seasoned speaker once told me, ‚Äúthe audience is actually rooting for you, because they‚Äôre thinking about if it were them and how unnerved they would be. They want you to do well.‚Äù</li>\n<li>If you didn‚Äôt belong here, you wouldn‚Äôt be here. So relax.</li>\n<li>Proper Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance‚Ä¶being prepared and practiced helps eliminate fear and build confidence.</li>\n<li>Be yourself. Authenticity goes a long way.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Locally, I love to hear <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zacharylbeer\">Zachary Beer</a> speak. He is smart, funny, and authentic as f*ck!</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://gotochgo.com/2020/speakers/1281/danielle-pollard\">Danielle‚Äôs talk at GOTO Chicago 2020 and how you can contact her here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

Today, I‚Äôm happy to bring you Avdi Grimm,\na Ruby developer and professional paired programmer who will be giving a talk on programming and philosophy (I love these kind\nof talks).</p>\n<p>In this interview, Avdi shares some of his thoughts on how code is used as a model for life and the benefits he‚Äôs seen\nfrom 10 years of public speaking.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Yke3jpFDhT96A8qM5vGn1zAHS2bUBDSW\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a developer who spends most of his time coaching and educating other developers these days. My primary source of income is <a href=\"https://www.rubytapas.com/\">RubyTapas.com</a>, a subscription screencast site I created for developers nine years ago. I specialize in making frequent, short, tightly-edited videos that introduce developers to one new and useful idea at a time.</p>\n<p>I got started speaking around 2010. <strong>I think my biggest reason was that back then I was under the misapprehension that I was an introvert, and speaking seemed like a handy socialization hack.</strong> The idea was, if I give a talk, people will introduce themselves to me!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love public speaking for its own sake, and I also very much enjoy traveling and meeting people. Speaking is interesting because on the one hand, it has been instrumental to my career. But on the other hand, it‚Äôs hard to trace the individual strands of causality. <strong>Many of my most delightful opportunities have stemmed from friends I made at a conference years earlier.</strong></p>\n<h3>What makes the intersection of philosophy and software such an interesting topic to you?</h3>\n<p>I honestly believe that <strong>programming is fundamentally the practice applied philosophy.</strong> We use code to model ways of thinking about the world we live in. And when our code is used by large numbers of people, it impacts how they see the world.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs a lot of power, and a lot of responsibility. It‚Äôs also an opportunity: learning to think critically and intentionally about the philosophical nature of our work can reveal new ways to bring our values and our work into alignment.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I think my first-ever talk was at an open-source conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was about tools for remote work, and it was not well-attended üòÖ</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I used to meditate a bit to calm myself down, with limited success. These days my favorite way to get ready is to be distracted by a conversation with an attendee until the moment comes to go on stage.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit early, submit often.</li>\n<li>It‚Äôs OK to submit an abstract on a topic you want to understand better: getting accepted will give you a great excuse to learn about it!</li>\n<li>In both proposals and the talks themselves, lead with a problem, not with information. What is your ideal audience-member worried about or frustrated with?</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt agonize over long articles about all the things you need to remember in order to give a good talk. Give yourself permission to suck at every aspect of doing your talk except one. E.g. maybe you‚Äôll suck at slides, pacing, narrative arc, delivery‚Ä¶ BUT you‚Äôll have some really funny stories! Then, in later talks, pick ONE new aspect to do be better at each time.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-Q_dXVQM1c' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù[No Return: Moving beyond transactions in software and in life](<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Q</a></em>dXVQM1c)‚Äù by Avdi Grimm_</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

This week, I‚Äôm featuring my interview with Denise Yu, a\nSenior Software Engineer at GitHub who has found speaking to be a great springboard for her career in tech.</p>\n<p>Like many speakers I‚Äôve talked to over the past year, Denise comes from a nontraditional background, and is deeply passionate about helping\nother speakers get their starts. She also included some great recommendations for other speakers to watch, so be sure\nto look for that section towards the end.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm about to start a job as a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub, working on the Community &#x26; Safety team. I previously worked at Pivotal in their Cloud R&#x26;D business, where I wrote lots of YAML and pair-programmed everyday.</p>\n<p>I make tech art ‚Äî mostly, doodling things quickly when I‚Äôm watching people speak at conferences, but also cat-related doodles of technical concepts, at <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/art/\">deniseyu.io/art</a>. I started public speaking when I was about 12 years old, because at that time I thought I wanted to grow up and become a lawyer. I joined my school‚Äôs debate club, and spent about the next 12 years participating, judging, teaching, and facilitating competitive debate, Model UN, Mock Trial, and lots of other speaking-related extracurricular activities.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>For me, technical speaking has been a pretty significant career accelerator. I‚Äôve met gracious and talented engineers who I consider to be mentors and sponsors, and <strong>I‚Äôve been able to network my way into every single job I‚Äôve taken, after my first job in tech, either as a direct or indirect result of my participation in public speaking at meetups and conferences. There‚Äôs no such thing as being too junior when you‚Äôre brave enough to get up in front of an audience and share what you know.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking has never officially been part of my job, but I‚Äôve been lucky to have had employers who supported my speaking endeavors by granting me paid time off to travel to conferences.</p>\n<h3>What makes distributed systems such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>I career-switched and didn‚Äôt study computer science in undergrad, so I have a persistent sense of imposter syndrome around missing out on foundational knowledge.</p>\n<p>I started becoming interested in the mechanics of distributed computing while debugging RabbitMQ issues in production a few years ago. I can‚Äôt remember the specifics now, but a customer experienced a network partition, and the RabbitMQ cluster nodes came back to life in an unexpected order, which caused a host of unexpected side effects.</p>\n<p>I had such poor understanding of the design decisions for partition recovery strategies, that I decided to start doing my own research, and uncovered a world of deep, deep academic research into resilience engineering for distributed systems. For someone with no computer science background, I found the reading material out there to be targeted at advanced practitioners, and it was so difficult to me to get started on learning about distsys, so I did the reasonable thing, which was to submit a talk proposal to DevOpsDays London promising to compare partition recovery strategies between a few popular open-source databases. (Side note: This was not a reasonable thing to do.)</p>\n<p>While I was writing this talk, I was also reading Martin Kleppmann‚Äôs book ‚ÄúDesigning Data-Intensive Applications‚Äù, and I realized that before I could even talk about network partition recovery strategies, I had to spend a significant amount of time laying groundwork around why these strategies even needed to exist in the first place. The talk evolved from ‚ÄúRabbitMQ vs. Kafka vs. Cassandra‚Äù into a more general discussion of why distributed systems are so hard to understand, operate, and maintain. I think that as this talk has further iterated and evolved, the constant thread has been that distributed systems are difficult to learn about, and there is always space to revisit the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I spoke at was SwanseaCon in 2017. I delivered a talk titled ‚ÄúBuilding Empowered Teams at Scale‚Äù. I am not sure if it was recorded, but <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/talks\">the slides are available on my website</a>.</p>\n<p>I pitched the talk because in my first few months at Pivotal, I saw that the product teams were so much more empowered to make their own decisions, than previous teams I‚Äôd worked on, and I thought that some pieces of our philosophy around building and managing teams would be interesting to share with the world.</p>\n<p><strong>I was terrified - not about presenting in public, but specifically about speaking to a room full of engineers who knew a lot more about software and organizations than I did.</strong> I remember being so nervous about the talk that I started writing it seven months in advance. My manager helped me connect with people in leadership within the org to interview about their perspectives ‚Äî which actually ended up being a really cool way to build rapport with very senior-level folks that I didn‚Äôt have day-to-day contact with.</p>\n<p>I think the talk went well - to be honest, my brain completely blurs out the exact memories of being on stage usually - but I was proud that I had pushed myself to pitch, create, and deliver a full-length conference talk, about 2.5 years into my career in tech so far.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I‚Äôve spoken at upwards of 20 conferences. I‚Äôve applied to more - I think I applied to 10 conferences last year and got accepted to 7. This year I‚Äôve been recycling talks and being less ambitious about submitting, because I‚Äôm switching jobs and want to invest my energy in getting ramped up.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>When I develop a new talk, I spend a lot of time doing research. I actually <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/2018/09/24/writing-tech-talks.html\">blogged about my process here</a>!</p>\n<p>As a former debate kid, <strong>the key thing that‚Äôs always worked for me is practicing in front of diverse test audiences before the big day.</strong> When I lived in London and was developing new talks regularly, I had a crew of tech friends who didn‚Äôt work with me at Pivotal, and I‚Äôd invite them over, cook them dinner, feed them wine and beer, and run my talk for them and ask for feedback. This always caught ‚ÄúPivotal-isms‚Äù that I subconsciously put in, and it‚Äôd be a good way to level-set about whether my talk made sense to people who didn‚Äôt work on the same types of software that I did.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I also have decks on this! I sometimes help local meetups with training new speaker and drumming up talk submissions for CFPs. <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/techtalks\">Here‚Äôs the 15-minute deck that I usually run</a>.</p>\n<p>For new speakers, particularly folks with non-linear trajectories into the tech industry like myself, I always tell them this: <strong>Your story is interesting. You have a unique voice and set of experiences, and someone out there wants to hear your story.</strong></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs great to get started with smaller and lower-pressure speaking environments like meetups and possibly even presenting to bootcamp students or university student groups.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQrNOMO7UDk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQrNOMO7UDk\">How to Tech Talk</a>‚Äù by Denise Yu</em></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I lead a team of amazing Engineers who build tools for our global supply chain users. Outside of my day job, I founded a company called Developer First to help organizations around the world build strong Engineering teams which I believe starts with developing confident, purposeful and inspiring leaders.</p>\n<p>I was absolutely terrified of public speaking throughout college and into the first couple years of my professional career. I avoided it at all costs and was a terrible speaker in front of an audience of any size. I eventually realized that I couldn‚Äôt continue avoiding public speaking and joined my organization‚Äôs Toastmaster‚Äôs club. I was thrilled to discover a safe and comfortable environment to practice my new skills and overcome my fears. I spent a couple years as a practicing member before being elected President of my local chapter.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is not a requirement of my role, but I enjoy the opportunity to connect with leaders outside of my organization and feel like I am inspiring and influencing others to reflect and potentially shift their mindsets on technical leadership.</p>\n<p><strong>My favorite experiences of speaking at conferences are the conversations I have with folks who approach me after my talk.</strong> It is very rewarding to hear how my ideas resonated with them and even more enjoyable when they share new ideas that I hadn‚Äôt thought of!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I speak about a variety of topics related to the unique challenges of being an engineering leader: people first leadership, time management, prioritization, effective communication, coaching developers, diversity &#x26; inclusion, effective on boarding programs, etc.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was part of an executive track at an engineering conference in NYC. I talked so fast that I finished my 45 minute talk in 20 minutes. I remember arriving to the speaker staging room 90 minutes early because I was so nervous that I would be late or not find the location. My confidence and skills were definitely lacking. However, I don‚Äôt regret any of it! I was passionate about the topic and strongly believe that you have to start somewhere. No video footage exists (thank goodness).</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied: hundreds</p>\n<p>Spoken at: ~25</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ut7jEkIf1ac' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7jEkIf1ac\">Developer First Leadership</a>‚Äù by Kate Wardin at React Boston</em></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I usually run through the slides about an hour before my talk. <strong>The more familiar the ideas are, the more comfortable I am.</strong> After that, I try to relax and maybe go introduce myself to other attendees during the break before my talk.</p>\n<p>Another tip: make sure you check what type of projector or input is needed before you arrive to speak!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DON‚ÄôT WAIT. START WITH ANYTHING.</strong> Submit topics that you feel even somewhat confident to present on, and then invest the time to fully research, compile content, and practice(!!). It is amazing how your idea will flourish and grow the longer you have to reflect on the topic, gather feedback, and learn through other experiences. You just need to start with something - anything that you are passionate about. If you have an idea swirling in your head for longer than a couple weeks, take some time to start drafting an abstract and outline.</li>\n<li>Make sure you propose a topic that you are passionate about. There is nothing worse than a dull speaker who isn‚Äôt personally energized by the topic.</li>\n<li>READING THE ROOM: <strong>Nothing kills confidence faster than making eye contact with members of the audience who seem skeptical or not engaged.</strong> I like to find the person (or people) that actively shows feedback (nods, smiles) and focus my attention on them throughout my talk. As for those skeptics, I have found that it is dangerous to interpret the non-verbals of humans that you don‚Äôt personally know. In fact, on several occasions, some of those ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù (or so I thought) approached me after my talk and expressed gratitude and shared that they loved my topic.</li>\n<li>Join a frequent flyer/hotel chain rewards program. Admittedly, I also got into conference speaking because I wanted an excuse to travel more and rack up those airline/hotel points. Check and check.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.developer-first.com/\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-wardin/\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/developer_first\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upcoming talks: NoFluffJustStuff US tour, StretchCon Budapest, &#x26; Developer First Tech Leadership Conference</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

There‚Äôs something unifying about knowing that technologists from every corner of the globe can meet together to offer their tips and thoughts to others, and Vincenzo mentioned a similar appreciation in his interview here. As a speaker, he‚Äôs gotten to travel across the world to give talks on a variety of topics. Vincenzo‚Äôs approach to coming up with new talk ideas is also really interesting.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/G2DRaCN.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Vincenzo Chianese, I am an Italian Software Developer that‚Äôs been working for the last 5 years in the WebAPIs space, providing tools for API Developers. I mostly code in TypeScript/JavaScript these days, but previously I‚Äôve worked with C#, C++ and VB6. I am an Auth0 Ambassador and a Google Developer Expert in WebTechnologies and I‚Äôve been living in Prague, Madrid and (starting in January) in Austin, TX.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The ability to travel and see new places. I think I‚Äôve been able to go on all the continents just because of the speaking engagements I had, which would have been impossible otherwise.</p>\n<p>Second? Networking with speakers; <strong>I met some of my best contacts I have in the space because of the conferences,</strong> and I even ended up organising a conference because of some people I met in Paris last year. You never know who you‚Äôre talking to ‚Äî and you can be surprised. Curiously enough, the content is really the last reason I‚Äôd go to a conference.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I have always refused to present basic-level stuff that you can easily find on the web (tutorials and documentation) or even worse marked products for the company I work for. <strong>So every 8-10 months I do kind of a retrospective of what I‚Äôve been working on and if I see a fit for an interesting talk (such as something that you don‚Äôt exactly do everyday, something that has never been treated elsewhere)</strong> ‚Äî I put up an abstract and a title and try to submit it around.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the topic is appreciated, but most of the times it is not. My point is ‚Äî I want to share experiences, not technical documents in an oral form.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I totally remember it. It was in 2015 at the mDevCamp and I was asked to replace a colleague that couldn‚Äôt make it. I was in an horrible condition (I had fever) and it was at the very last moment. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the company unrepresented to I took the bet and had the presentation anyway.</p>\n<p>I must say, my English has improved since then, I promise.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYvsept0oio' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://slideslive.com/38894088/building-resilient-api-client\">Building resilient API client</a>‚Äù by Vincenzo Chianese at mDevCamp</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>In general, I apply to everything that makes sense, no matter the location or the timing of the year; that‚Äôs something I prefer to figure out later. Although I had a lot of speaking engagements, I still get rejected by default by most of the events. Some conference organisers that I met personally saw that I usually bring solid topics and so they were kind enough to invite me back. Anyway, I think my ratio is 1/5 (every 5 submissions, one goes through and gets accepted). You can do the math.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I found myself in the world of the conferences accidentally and I had basically no training. Here are some things I wish I would have done before doing this serially and seriously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find a local Meetup in your native language. You need to get confident in front of the crowd and the meet-ups are perfect: low expectations, willingness to listen from the audience and the ‚Äúeven-if-everything-fails-nothing-happens‚Äù guarantee that will make you feel comfortable. Rinse and repeat 2-3 times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find a meetup in English, and try the same talk. You will probably have to pay for your own flight (although a lot of meetups in Europe give talks in English anyway), but it‚Äôs an investment, so totally worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time to apply to a conference.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I‚Äôve also wrote a small essay on what to keep in mind when sending a CFP to a conference, <a href=\"https://dev.to/vncz/a-reviewer-s-perspective-on-getting-your-conference-proposal-accepted-1e6p\">sharing some thoughts as an organiser</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rNiq6xr.png?1\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://crate.io/\">Crate.io</a> which means I am working closely with the community of engineers using CrateDB. I am speaking at a lot at conferences, holding webinars, writing tutorials and articles. I got into public speaking after joining a program called <a href=\"https://events.mozilla.org/techspeakers\">Mozilla Tech Speakers</a>. I gave my first talk in 2016 in Russia.</p>\n<p>I have been going to conferences for a while now and I have met some truly amazing speakers from whom I have learnt a lot. I thought, why not record our conversations and make them available as a podcast so that a lot more people can benefit from it? This is a side project that is very dear to me on which I am concentrating on these days. It is called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">Technically True</a> and I chat with inspiring people in the industry to gain insights on topics related to public speaking and developer relations.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Initially, one of the strongest incentives was travelling to new places. Over time, the thing I liked the most about this was meeting new developer communities, engaging with them and of course, speaking and sharing what I have been working on.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences helped me gain more exposure and until the end of 2018, it was something that I did just for fun. Then I realised that I used up almost all of my vacation days for speaking at conferences and that now maybe it is time that I should do this full-time. That is when I decided to quit my job and join Crate.io this year as a full-time Developer Advocate. It‚Äôs been almost a year that speaking has been a part of my daily work and I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>These days, I have been speaking a lot about databases, industry 4.0, machine and time-series data. I especially enjoy talking about case-studies related to IoT that we do with our clients. I also speak on WebXR with A-Frame and building multiplayer games with that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Sure, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was very thrilled about it but got very nervous the day before I had to give the talk. I experienced a cocktail of feelings like impostor syndrome, adrenaline rush and anxiety. Once I started speaking, I realised that I was really enjoying it and all the fear melted away. The talk went well, I had a lot of questions and the feedback was good. I watched the recorded video later on and identified a lot of things that I had to fix like filler words and so on. It‚Äôs not easy to watch a video of your talk but trust me, it can be the best way to improve your speaking skills. I even have a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZTJOhz6INQ\">my first talk on YouTube</a>, it helps me realize how far I have come and how far I still have to go.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZTJOhz6INQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúGetting Started With Web Based Virtual Reality‚Äù by Tanay Pant (his first conference talk)</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied to? Hundreds! Spoken at? I think it is probably close to twenty-five.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that is the most important for me is putting my Slack, laptop and mobile on do not disturb. I always take off my watch before going on the stage - loose watches can create a distraction for both the speakers and the audience by going up and down the wrist. Smartwatches on the other hand can light up with hand movements. I use an app called HiddenMe for hiding all the icons, files and folders from my Desktop, especially if I have to give a demo and need to exit Powerpoint. I think that it‚Äôs important to have a bottle of water on the stage especially for longer talks.</p>\n<p>I recently talked about pre-talk rituals with Niels Leenheer and you can hear stories from us about the things we do and why we do them <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">in the episode coming out on December 1</a>.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Well, there‚Äôs SO many things. Let‚Äôs go through a speaker‚Äôs journey from picking a topic to chatting with the audience at the end of the talk.</p>\n<p>First of all, topic selection. It‚Äôs most important to choose something really interesting to you, something that you are passionate about. That plays a huge factor in how much confidence and enthusiasm you have when you are up on the stage. If you‚Äôd like to know more about CFPs and how conferences select talks, I can highly recommend following <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/talk-selection-in-conferences-with-kristina-schneider\">Kristina Schneider‚Äôs advice</a> on the topic (she organises CSSConfEU).</p>\n<p>Once your talk is ready, make sure to practice it well but also beware of over-rehearsing. Practising your talk a couple of times helps you to further tailor your talks and make them leaner. It also helps you with your confidence on stage in case something goes sideways.</p>\n<p>If something doesn‚Äôt go exactly as you wanted to on the stage or if the demo fails, make a joke about it and move on. Make sure that you have a video that you can show in its place. Don‚Äôt let it affect the rest of your talk and your morale. Things go wrong, it‚Äôs okay. This happens to everybody.</p>\n<p>Make sure you stick around after you talk to answer the questions from the audience and help them in any way you can. <strong>Never forget that the audience is the most important group in that room and always be humble.</strong> I can go on about this topic for hours, if you have more questions DO reach out to me.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One of the talks that have inspired me the most was given by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mio_Loclair\">Christian Mio Loclair</a> in Berlin about <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/273373088\">Narciss</a> back in 2018. Having said that, there are a countless number of people who have inspired me and I usually end up inviting them to my podcast. üòÖ</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am most active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanay1337\">Twitter</a> but I can also be found on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337\">LinkedIn</a>.

While many tech conference speakers do it for their own personal development, some are specifically hired to speak, travel, and be a face for the community. That‚Äôs what Nicolas does now, but like all speakers, it‚Äôs taken a journey to get there. In today‚Äôs Speaker Story, we hear how Nicolas got started as well as some of his tips for new conference speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Nicolas Fr√§nkel, a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a>. My main job is to speak at conferences, so that people know about Hazelcast the In-Memory-Data-Grid and <a href=\"https://jet.hazelcast.org/\">Jet</a>. I‚Äôm also the point of contact for the community.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been a teacher for more than 20 years, given that the best way to learn is to teach. However, some subjects are not relevant in academia. I discovered the <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/\">Vaadin web framework</a>, and I was so enthralled by it that I wanted to show it to the members of my local Java User Group. That was 7 years ago.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EOLCiAD.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects! For example, last summer, I was feeling a bit down with so much travelling around. I arrived at my hotel just a couple of hours before a talk. I wasn‚Äôt happy to be there, but I went to give the talk. After that, I felt really better, all bad feelings had been washed away.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I started public speaking at my Java user group one evening. Soon afterwards, when I travelled for work, I started to propose local user groups to host my talk. Then, I took vacations to speak at international conferences. I did more and more of them. <strong>But at one point, I realized that was pretty dumb to be paid to do a dull job (consulting on development/architecture) while taking vacations to do something that I really liked.</strong> One year ago, I steered my career toward Developer Advocacy, which includes a large part of public speaking.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a tech guy, so in general I stick to technical subjects. They include Java - it has been my bread and butter for years, Kotlin, Spring and Spring Boot, DevOps, Kubernetes and of course, Hazelcast IMDG and Jet.</p>\n<p>I once did a motivational talk, but it was quite hard for me. I might do more organizational/management-related talks in the future, as I already wrote some related blog posts already. But it means going far out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first talk at my local user group very vividly.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I was used to teach, but to talk in front of your peers is very different. <strong>When teaching, you speak from a position of power; when speaking in front of your peers, they will judge you - in a good or a bad way, and it will have a lasting effect.</strong> For this reason, I had asked some good friends to come, and they did. The room was overflowing with people, with some sitting on the stairs. I was very nervous before the talk, and in the first few minutes. Then, just like when coding, I focused on the subject at hand and went ‚Äúinto the zone‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember the specifics afterwards, it was just ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I believe the talk went pretty well, as I remember people clapping, and thus it was a great experience that helped me apply to speak again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt keep the count of the number of conferences I‚Äôve submitted to, but to give you a rough idea, this year, I‚Äôll speak at a total of 68 conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have routine per se, but I like to be at my place and prepared far in advance (at least 20 minutes). Being early was useful for a conference at the earlier this year, when I noticed very early that the projector didn‚Äôt work, and I had to run to find someone to help me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Wow, answering this question could easily fill a book!</p>\n<p>Regarding impostor syndrome, the main advice would be the following: I often hear great and skilled people not submitting talks because they‚Äôre afraid they have nothing new to say. Well, if that would be the case, not many people would do public speaking. I believe on the opposite that <strong>most people have a unique experience and bring a unique viewpoint, even to subjects that have been spoken about a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>For finding conferences, I use <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a> and <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">sessionize.com</a>. They also allow to write your bio and abstract once, find your conferences, and then submit them at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>For the rest, I already wrote a post named <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Advices for junior conference speakers</a> that might be of interest. Expect more to come in the future.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I became exposed to the world of Developer Advocacy through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaruch\">Baruch Sadogursky</a>. He was the one that made me understand by his behavior that public speaking could be a job - or at least a part thereof.</p>\n<p>For the sheer number of talks, I need to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbuxman\">Josh Long</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. As the latter told when he introduced himself during a panel is: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Venkat, I live in a plane‚Äù. And then he passed the mic.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/\">blog where I publish a weekly post</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tChR2X7.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Other than being married to Liron and a father to Yaara and Yuval, I‚Äôm also working at Nielsen, the data and measurement company. I work for a division called Nielsen Marketing Cloud, as the tech lead of the big data group (sometimes people confuse ‚Äútech lead‚Äù with ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù, so I wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/tech-lead-dont-you-mean-team-lead-c8bde92e38ab\">short post</a> to explain what I see as a tech lead üòÉ).</p>\n<p>In addition to that, I‚Äôm also a co-founder and a core team member of the Israeli chapter of <a href=\"https://www.womeninbigdata.org/\">Women in Big Data</a>.</p>\n<p>I actually got into public speaking more than 10 years ago, when I was invited to give a talk about Mainframes to a group of young soldiers during their basic programming course in the army. I really enjoyed it, and since then I‚Äôve had the chance to talk about various topics in several different forums, ranging from internal sessions, through local meetups, all the way to international conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>While speaking at conferences is not part of my job per se, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs beneficial for my career in the long run, but that‚Äôs definitely not the main reason for me to do it. The main reason is actually the fact that it gives me an opportunity to meet a lot of smart people and share my knowledge with them - I absolutely love it!</p>\n<p>There are two added bonuses for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I get to attend other talks and learn from others as well.</li>\n<li>After I give a talk, people come up to me and ask questions, which always leads to very interesting conversations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bottom line - speaking at conferences is an awesome experience.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>In the last 7 years or so, I‚Äôve been a big data developer and tech lead, so naturally I cover big data related topics, usually frameworks and tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Apache Druid.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve worked on data-centric systems since the early days of my career, and it‚Äôs funny how sometimes the terminology is similar, while the underlying technology has significantly evolved (e.g Mainframe batch jobs vs a Spark batch jobs). As a data engineer, it‚Äôs exciting to be able to use cutting-edge tools to process the ever-increasing amounts of data, and so is the opportunity to share with others how we actually use those tools.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I definitely remember that talk! It was a local conference about 2.5 years ago, where my colleague, Yakir Buskilla (who‚Äôs now our VP R&#x26;D), and I spoke about how we use Druid for interactive count-distinct queries at scale.</p>\n<p>It was the first time I gave a talk to such a large audience (about 400 people), and I was excited (and a bit nervous of course‚Ä¶). We got great feedback after the talk, so I guess you can say it went well.</p>\n<p>You can check out the video recording of that talk below (my part starts at 12:01 minutes):</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOIJEBIVFDY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúUsing Druid for Interactive Count Distinct Queries at Scale‚Äù with Yakir Buskilla and Itai Yaffe</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since I joined Nielsen, over 5 years ago, I applied to around 10 conferences, and was accepted to about 7 of them. 2019 has been extremely successful for me as a speaker, presenting and co-presenting at 5 different conferences throughout the year. I also speak at meetups and other forums quite often.</p>\n<p>And, I‚Äôve already started working on my applications for next year‚Äôs conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I arrive a few minutes earlier to the location I‚Äôm going to talk at, and make sure everything is set-up properly. I also keep a bottle of water close by (just in case). Last but not least, it‚Äôs always helpful to pick a positive thought or idea that can lift your spirit and energize you right before getting on stage. I sometimes use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM\">Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù</a> (apparently, this is even <a href=\"https://loudwire.com/queen-dont-stop-me-now-worlds-most-uplifting-song/\">backed by a scientific study</a>).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I can give, is to[read my blog post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/how-to-present-at-meetups-and-survive-and-what-does-freddie-mercury-have-to-do-with-it-614b22a7fa9b\">How to present at meetups and survive (and what does Freddie Mercury have to do with it?)</a> üòÉ</p>\n<p>But to summarize the tips from that post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Success doesn‚Äôt (usually) happen overnight, it takes a lot of work.</li>\n<li>Try to make your talk a story worth telling - people always want to hear real-life stories about how others have dealt with common challenges.</li>\n<li>Practice makes perfect - conduct a lot of dry-runs and get early feedback.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let criticism get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let yourself get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt forget to enjoy!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been to several conferences and seen many great speakers, but I really look up to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\">Holden Karau</a> - her talks are always awesome, funny and insightful!</p>\n<p>She‚Äôs involved in quite a few open-source projects, and it‚Äôs really impressive she‚Äôs able to contribute to the open-source community both in terms of coding and in terms of sharing her knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôd love to meet you at <a href=\"https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe\">Spark+AI Summit Europe</a> on October 15-17 in Amsterdam, where I‚Äôll be talking about <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session_eu19/stream-stream-stream-different-streaming-methods-with-apache-spark-and-kafka\">different streaming methods with Spark and Kafka</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CXHhfJH.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm an Engineering Coach at Help Scout, and my daily job is to make sure that the engineers on my team are successful and that we‚Äôre shipping features that our customers love.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking at a young age. I did one-act plays in high school, and I also competed in <a href=\"https://www.uiltexas.org/speech/oral-interp/2019-20-uil-poetry-categories\">UIL poetry interpretation</a>. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity‚Äôs ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences!</p>\n<p>I give my talks because <strong>I believe that I have something to say that will help the attendees be better at the work they do</strong>. So, speaking is a way that I can help people, and helpfulness is one of my core values. There‚Äôs nothing better than the feeling I get when people come up to me after my talk (or sometimes weeks/months later) and tell me how it changed the way they thought about the topic. It‚Äôs even better when they share how it changed their behavior!</p>\n<p>Speaking isn‚Äôt part of my job, but it has greatly benefited my career. During job interviews, <strong>I‚Äôve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!</strong> While giving great talks alone wouldn‚Äôt have gotten me the offer, being qualified and a good speaker has been an incredible combination!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>My two primary topics are technology leadership and diversity and inclusion. My technology leadership talks draw on core principles as well as historical examples.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/leadership-lessons-from-the-agile-manifesto/\">Leadership Lessons from the Agile Manifesto</a> talk takes the values of the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and distills lessons for engineering managers and technical leads. I give easy to understand guidelines for making the tough decisions that leaders have to make when guiding engineering teams.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/technical-leadership-through-the-underground-railroad/\">Technical Leadership Through the Underground Railroad</a> talk uses the story of the daring John P. Parker who was a Conductor on the legendary Underground Railroad. I use his experience helping a group of enslaved people in 19th Century America escape from the Slave States to freedom.</p>\n<p>I give a talk with my wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons, called <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/managing-the-burnout-burndown/\">Managing the Burnout Burndown</a>, and we use the burndown chart used my many Agile teams as a metaphor for burning down stress. We describe how protecting your health, forming strong relationships, and removing distractions can help you avoid burn out.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/lending-privilege/\">Lending Privilege</a> talk describes how everyone has privilege and can use it to create a more diverse and inclusive technology industry. We can all help those who lack our privileges be more visible, have their voices heard, and get a chance to contribute their expertise to the software development process at our companies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at Podcamp Houston back in 2009. I think it went very well!</p>\n<p>My talk was called ‚ÄúRestoring Tech Cred to Houston‚Äù, and I made the case for Houston being an often overlooked tech hub when compared to other areas of the country like Silicon Valley, New York City, and Austin. One thing that‚Äôs important to know about this first talk was that I had the fortune of getting a lot of speaking experience as a normal part of my job. As an engineering manager, I did a lot of speaking as a person tasked with leading development teams. Of course, this work was done inside company walls and was not visible to the public. However, I found that when I did start public speaking I already had a great set of skills just from what I did at work.</p>\n<p><strong>So, if you‚Äôre a new speaker, you probably are more experienced than you realize if your job requires you to do a lot of communication (even if it‚Äôs just in small team meetings or Slack conversations).</strong></p>\n<p>My first large conference talk was at South by Southwest in 2010, and I went on to speak there several times. I started to really get serious about speaking at conferences when I did a Lightning Talk at OSCON in 2016. That‚Äôs when my public speaking work really began to take off!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I would guess over 500. I‚Äôve spoken at about 50 conferences so that tells you how tough the ratio of applications to acceptances can be.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a numbers game, and <strong>you shouldn‚Äôt let the rejection emails get you down</strong>. I‚Äôve spoken at conferences on three different continents, and I still regularly get rejected. Keep applying and refining your proposals. You‚Äôll start getting acceptances which usually lead to a higher acceptance rate.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine is meant to minimize variables and distractions as much as possible. I avoid drinking or eating anything two hours before my talk. That reduces the chance that I‚Äôll have an upset stomach or have to deal with digestion issues. I may drink coffee, but no later than 30 minutes before I go on stage (to avoid being too jittery).</p>\n<p>I make sure I‚Äôve been mic‚Äôd and have done a sound check and laptop check at least 30 minutes before my talk. I want to make sure that the mic is working, my slides are properly displayed on the screens, and my clicker (I use a <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote\">Logitech Spotlight</a>) and laptop are both fully charged.</p>\n<p>I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified. üòÉ</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you have something to say</strong>. Even an entry level talk can provide a ton of value. There is always someone who is new to the topic and needs help understanding the core concepts. Also, <strong>even people who are experts need reminders best practices and first principles</strong>. So, don‚Äôt count yourself out just because you think you‚Äôre not an expert.</p>\n<p>Second, pick one or two topics that you‚Äôre passionate about and use those for your talk proposals. You know you‚Äôre passionate about a topic if you‚Äôre already spending a lot of time reading about it, thinking about it, and debating it with people on Twitter. Wrap your talks around your passions. That way, you won‚Äôt get tired of your talks (it can happen over time), and the audience will sense your excitement. If you‚Äôre not excited about what you‚Äôre talking about, then how can the people in the seats get excited about you?</p>\n<p>Third, rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. I‚Äôve given a lot of talks, and I still get nervous. However, the best remedy I‚Äôve found for anxiety about stepping on stage is rehearse. You don‚Äôt have to memorize everything you‚Äôre going to say, but you need to have a solid idea of the journey you‚Äôre taking the audience on in your talk.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I look up to and have been inspired by so many speakers. Here is a list of their Twitter accounts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/catehstn\">https://twitter.com/catehstn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss\">https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nodunayo\">https://twitter.com/nodunayo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahmei\">https://twitter.com/sarahmei</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lara_hogan\">https://twitter.com/lara_hogan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi\">https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager\">https://twitter.com/Geek_Manager</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wiredferret\">https://twitter.com/wiredferret</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/skamille\">https://twitter.com/skamille</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sharonsteed\">https://twitter.com/sharonsteed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kytrinyx\">https://twitter.com/kytrinyx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/heddle317\">https://twitter.com/heddle317</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek\">https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/6Gems\">https://twitter.com/6Gems</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the speaker that I look up to the most and inspires me every day is my wife who you can <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aneika\">follow on Twitter here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>You can find more about me on my <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anjuan\">Twitter</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anjuan/\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

After speaking at local several meetups, Adri√°n started applying to conferences and has now been a speaker at 4 international gatherings. One of my favorite parts about speaking is the same as Adri√°n‚Äôs: meeting people from around the world.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sZRtBDT.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>My name is Adri√°n Bolonio. I‚Äôm an experienced Spanish Frontend developer and Web Team Lead, focusing now in Web Accessibility (a11y). Since 2012 I‚Äôve been living and working in Vienna. I currently work at <a href=\"www.willhaben.at\">willhaben</a>, the biggest classified company in Austria with the 2nd highest traffic of all Austrian websites.</p>\n<p>I started speaking at local meetups in Vienna, such as ViennaJS, ReactJS and then I talked at the DevFest Vienna, organised by the local Google Developer Group. I had the opportunity to organise an internal frontend conference inside my company for 100 people and I gave a talk as well there. I‚Äôm now sending more CFPs to International conferences to continue my speaking path.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like the feeling to contribution to the community. Sharing the knowledge I‚Äôve acquired over the years as a developer helps me improve my public speaking skills as well. Another thing that I love from conferences is networking and meeting new and amazingly interesting people from all over the world who share your interest and sometimes even hobbies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first talk. It was in the Vienna JS meetup, and I talked about a new library my team and I built at my current company. The idea was to share the library and promote it as open-source so anyone could use it. I was extremely nervous before going onto the stage, but the fact that my audience were developers too allowed me to relax a bit. At the end it went very well and smoothly. I got some very interesting questions after the talk and the people liked it.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJXzyHHh4pc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adri√°n Bolonio at ViennaJS</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to around 15 international conferences so far.

Now I‚Äôm a bit more experienced, so I check that my computer has enough battery or I have a charger that works. I check that all my other applications are closed and my notifications are muted. I check that the microphone works properly and the screen where the presentation is shown is readable from any point in the venue.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think the best and more difficult advice is ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs ok to be a bit nervous, but try to understand that if you have been chosen to give a talk at a conference or at a local meetup it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre an expert in that field, so you know what you‚Äôre talking about. Just calm down, enjoy the talk, and accept any feedback.</p>\n<p>It needs to be fun for you, you don‚Äôt have to suffer, so please enjoy the process.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9yzgNfr.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I work as Software Engineer at Growth Manager at <a href=\"https://echobind.com/\">Echobind</a>, a remote web and mobile consultancy for healthcare, life science, and technology companies (we‚Äôre hiring!) . On the side, I am also working on growing DevLifts, a company I started to help developers get fit.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking through starting to speak at local meetups a few years ago, and then subsequently running 3 meetups and having a hard time finding speakers sometimes.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences because I get to share my ideas with a lot of people in a conversational (and more human) manner (as opposed to Twitter) and have those ideas put to the test. I also love getting to meet lots of new developers! Attending conferences is obviously a way to do that, but speaking can make it easier since people will want to come talk to you after your talk.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I actually just gave my first conference talk earlier this month! Going into it, I was a little nervous just because I was covering a fairly sensitive topic (fitness &#x26; health), but it went great. I got to meet a bunch of developers and hear about what they do to stay fit and healthy.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Until recently, I had applied to maybe 5-6 conferences and been rejected by all by 1. But in the past 2 months I got more aggressive with it and have applied to 30ish conferences. I‚Äôve been accepted by 3 so far.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>About 15 minutes before, I‚Äôll make sure to find the MC (or whoever is in charge of getting me to the right place for my talk) and checking in with them so they know where I am. I‚Äôll have a glass of water and go to the bathroom. Then I‚Äôll grab another glass of water to sip throughout the talk if necessary. I‚Äôll also turn my phone off and put it in my backpack or somewhere not on my person. Most importantly, I always make sure my notifications are muted!!!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> gave me some fantastic advice before my first conference talk. I was a bit nervous and he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not nervous. You‚Äôre excited.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Nervousness is inward focused ‚Äî I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll screw up, I‚Äôm afraid something will go wrong, I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll hate my talk, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll start Twitter war.</p>\n<p>Being excited is outward focused ‚Äî I‚Äôm excited to give this talk to help others with this area of their lives. I‚Äôm doing this because I want to help other developers. If at least one person walks away feeling good/empowered/excited/etc., I‚Äôll be happy.</p>\n<p>As a conference organizer, I‚Äôll also say to new speakers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Show up early (at least an hour before your talk). This makes the organizers much less stressed if they know you are in the building because they‚Äôve seen you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure the MC can find you 15-20 minutes before your talk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice your talk. If you didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs obvious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be flexible. Organizing conferences is hard and usually being done for free as a labor of love. Being a diva because you can‚Äôt get a certain type of water will definitely get you on the <em>do-not-invite-back</em> list.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>So many, but here are a few:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> is hands down the best speaker I know. I love being part of his audience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler\">Ken Wheeler</a> has the best combination of jokes and crazy good demos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dabit3\">Nader Dabit</a> got me into speaking because he‚Äôs one of the first people I saw give a tech talk at our local meetup years ago.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a> because daaaaaang does that dude know how to keep a crowd engaged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\">Brian Holt</a> because his talks have always been funny, mind-blowing, and approachable to me.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next scheduled conference talk is at <a href=\"https://connect.tech/\">Connect.tech</a> this October!

Just two years ago, she was working at a minimum wage fast-food job, and now she‚Äôs been accepted to speak at 8 tech conferences about topics ranging from her journey to VR development in React. Not many stories out there are as inspiring at Tae‚Äôlur‚Äôs, so read on and hear what she‚Äôs learned along the way.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Y6wxxj3.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I am a Front-End Engineer and technical content creator. I‚Äôm currently a freelance technical writer and in my current contract position, I‚Äôm writing product documentation &#x26; user guides. I also write tutorials on topics such as Git &#x26; Gatsby.</p>\n<p>My mission is to make the learning curve of software development an easier process for everyone. I got into speaking after I was invited to share my story of how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaelurAlexis/status/1046663234978115585\">I transitioned into tech from fast food</a> at CascadiaJS in November 2018. A few months later, I decided to just follow accounts like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfp_land\">@cfpland</a> and submit talks!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like how I‚Äôm putting myself out there and slowly yet surely coming out of my introverted shell. I‚Äôve always had a secret obsession with researching and curating resources so being able to travel and present my findings is my thing. The public speaking is a strategic move, my goal is to get into developer advocacy.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7idBFx7erWA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tae‚Äôlur Alexis, ‚ÄúCreating 3D User Experiences with React‚Äù at React 360</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first solo conference talk was just recently actually! It occurred June 6, 2019. It was RefactrTech, a conference based in Atlanta and the presentation was titled, ‚ÄúBuilding Accessible UI with React‚Äù. The talk consisted of me discussing ways you can improve the accessibility of your application and the different libraries and tools you can use.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to at least 15, have been accepted to 8 and have spoken at one so far.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My process has so far been to gather so many resources on the topic I‚Äôm presenting on and read through the documentation and possibly experiment with building demos. Building demos can really help you with learning the ins and outs on a topic and you never know what you may uncover.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Advice I‚Äôd give to new speakers before they give a talk is to remember these are regular people who are rooting for you. And the biggest step is to just be there. And when it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over. Afterwards you‚Äôre free to roam, explore and breathe.</p>\n<p>You don‚Äôt need to be an expert, just be passionately curious. Follow @cfp_land, have an interesting talk title and abstract (summary of what your talk would be on) and just submit to every conference that‚Äôs relevant to your interests. You can submit multiple talks and I highly encourage you do so. People call this ‚Äúconference-driven development‚Äù. The submissions are reviewed and approved MONTHS before the conference actually happens so you‚Äôll have time.</p>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that‚Äôs worked for me is to literally search ‚Äútech cfp‚Äù on Twitter!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eveporcello\">Eve Porcello</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a> are my top inspirations.</p>\n<p>CascadiaJS was the first conference I‚Äôve ever attended and as stated, it occurred in November 2018. Eve Porcello invited me to her GraphQL workshop at CascadiaJS in Seattle and seeing how comfortable she was presenting on such an advanced topic was so inspiring. And then to know she‚Äôs authored O‚ÄôReilly books and travels doing conference talks and workshops for a living BLEW. MY. MIND.</p>\n<p>Then I meet Marcy Sutton who embraced me after I spoke on stage about my story. Her passion around accessibility and learning more about her role in developer advocacy is literally why I do what I do today. They are both the reason why I‚Äôve pursued accessibility and developer advocacy. I want to be able to use my interest in writing and community engagement to make an impact and have a nomadic career.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/TaelurAlexis\">follow me on Twitter</a> and I post weekend recaps on what I have going on in my life <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TaelurAlexis\">on YouTube here</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm building an online platform called <a href=\"https://codeeveryday.io/\">CodeEveryday</a> where I‚Äôm providing learning resources, mentorship and job postings so you can subscribe to the newsletter as we prep for the release!

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Many technical leads that I‚Äôve spoken to don‚Äôt realize how much knowledge they have that others do not. It‚Äôs easy when you\nspend every day working with caching in Ruby, for example, to forget that most devs never get the chance to do what you do.\nLike Molly, many speakers realize that their unique knowledge is worth sharing, and start getting on stage. In this interview,\nwe talked about Molly‚Äôs journey and some of her advice for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sU57xj3.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am currently the Lead Site Reliability Engineer at Kenna Security. I have been working at Kenna for almost 4 years now and I got into public speaking last year thanks to the support at Kenna.</p>\n<p>My lead at the time suggested that I find ways I could share my knowledge with others. I had become extremely proficient and knowledge about making performance improvements in our Ruby application so I started with sharing that knowledge internally and then decided to try submitting a talk on it to a conference. I submitted a proposal to RubyConf not thinking anything would come of it. Because my expectations were low I also submitted a talk to a local meetup about another technical passion of mine, Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, BOTH talks were accepted and my Fall quickly became very busy. I had done debate and was good at speaking in high school, but I was not sure what to expect from technical speaking. After giving my first talk and seeing the response it got and how thankful the people were, I was hooked! It has been less than a year since that first talk and I have given 2 conference talks since, plus a few Meetup talks.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I enjoy being able to share my advice with a lot of people at once. It is like mentoring or giving advice on steroids. I also really enjoy getting out of the office and getting to meet other devs. Everyone has such difference experiences and being able to chat with everyone is a great way to bring back new ideas and learn new things.</p>\n<p>It has definitely benefited my career because I have made so many amazing professional connections via speaking. All of my talks were inspired by my work, but are not required for me to do my job. The speaking and additional connections I have made have also benefited Kenna as well in the form of bringing in job candidates. Kenna has been very supportive of all the speaking and covers all of my expenses whenever I speak.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>You bet I do since it was last November! It went fabulous! For a few days after I was on a high from it.</p>\n<p>I have looked up to many speakers and the idea of me being up on the stage was almost something I couldn‚Äôt comprehend. Once I did it, I was amazed with myself and also immediately ready to do it again! My only regret was that I left my necklace on and that interfered with the mic near the end. I was worried that it might have been horrible for those listening, but no one said anything. I don‚Äôt think many people even noticed. Being a perfectionist, I definitely did. But live and learn!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEi-vYcyTT8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2018-cache-is-king-get-the-most-bang-for-your-buck-from-ruby\">Cache is King: Get the Most Bang for Your Buck From Ruby by Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I have spoken at 3 conferences and applied to probably 9, some of which are this fall so I am waiting to hear back about those. The 3 conferences I have spoken at have all been Ruby conferences which have been incredible! A couple I applied to in the Fall are Site Reliability and DevOps conferences. I am interested, if accepted, to see how they differ.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I am a big proponent of practicing my talk!</p>\n<p>I know some people who prefer not to practice and they do better when they wing it, but I am not one of those people. I like to know exactly what I am going to say when I get up there. Because of that I practice my talk a lot and I memorize my intro and ending so those are guaranteed to go smoothly. Right before I talk I like to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en\">Power Pose</a>. But when I Power Pose, I do it with a twist. I recite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zFHkBQBg-4\">these lines from Jr in Cool Runnings</a> All of that helps me feel really confident and bad ass before I go on.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I have for new speakers, especially those who feel intimidated by speaking at a conference, is to start small. <strong>Begin by giving talks internally at your company first.</strong> It could be as simple as giving a demo of a feature you built. From there, consider lightening talks at a conference or even a talk at a Meetup. Once you are comfortable, then apply to a conference.</p>\n<p>If you are a new speaker that has already been accepted to give a conference talk then my best advice would be to <strong>give your talk in a smaller setting about a month before</strong>. This forces you to get the talk done early which will save you from last minute, frantic cramming. It will also allow you to get some feedback on the talk. I gave my first conference talk 3 times before RubyConf. I gave it at 2 small meetups and once for my coworkers. Every time I got great feedback that I was able to use to tweak the talk and make it more clear and approachable.</p>\n<p>Picking a topic can also be a struggle for people who want to get started, but sometimes feel they have nothing ‚Äúnew‚Äù to talk about. First and foremost, <strong>ANY topic is fair game even if people have talked about it before</strong>. You can always bring a new perspective to a topic. Even presenting new examples for a topic could help someone who has heard the topic a thousand times finally understand it. My first conference talk I wrote, Cache is King, I thought for sure it was too ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and not ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù enough to ever be considered. But I quickly learned, most conference talks aren‚Äôt about discovering something new, they are about taking a topic and presenting it in a way that is approachable and helps your audience learn something.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek\">Saron Yitbarek</a> has been HUGELY inspirational as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/r00k\">Ben Ornstein</a>.</p>\n<p>Right after I got accepted to speak at my first conference I watched Saron‚Äôs talk on building a community which gave me all the good feels I needed to believe I could take on this daunting task. I then watched Ben Ornstein‚Äôs talk on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JXH7JPjR4\">How to Give a Technical Talk</a> and that really inspired me to make my speech relatable and entertaining. My favorite quote is, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt teach them anything if you don‚Äôt have their attention‚Äù</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have been pretty good about keeping my personal website up to date and that is <a href=\"https://www.mollystruve.com/\">www.mollystruve.com</a>. There I have links to my Twitter, blog, Instagram, Facebook, etc. I am also very passionate about blogging so I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt include a link directly to my blog, <a href=\"https://dev.to/molly_struve\">dev.to/mollystruve</a>.</p>\n<p>I am a big fan of taking a talk and breaking it down into blog posts so it can reach more people.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a Lead Designer at 8th Light, a custom software consultancy. I do UX and front-end development and work with various clients on designing and building their software.</p>\n<p>I was never interested in public speaking, but before I became a designer about 3 years ago I worked at an education-focused non-profit, and have a background in teaching, so I‚Äôve always been pretty comfortable in the very small scale stage of a classroom. Before I started at 8th Light I volunteered doing a workshop about domestic violence, and part of my apprenticeship involved doing a talk for a small group of people, and I did that workshop.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of positive feedback, and eventually did a version of it at our internal company conference. A while later, a co-worker who was organizing a Ruby conference asked me to do a short talk about how developers could do quick usability testing, so that they could have good UX of features they were building when there wasn‚Äôt a designer in the room. That talk went pretty well despite the fact that I felt like I was going to pass out the entire time.</p>\n<p>I did that talk at another conference, but quickly felt a strong urge to go back to speaking about something I really cared about. I had been thinking for a long time about the ways that technology enables domestic violence, and had been collecting examples, but never felt like I was an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù enough to do a talk about it. It really seemed like something that other, smarter people were working on. But eventually I realized that wasn‚Äôt true, that if someone out there was already talking about this stuff, I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me find them.</p>\n<p>Right around that time, Russ Unger, who leads UX Camp in Chicago, responded to a proposal I‚Äôd submitted saying my topic wasn‚Äôt quite right, and he asked ‚Äúis there anything else you‚Äôve though about doing a talk about?‚Äù I told him about my idea for a talk about how tech enables domestic violence, and he said that would be perfect for the conference. I owe him a lot for taking the time to figure out that this talk was on my mind and giving me what I needed to finally do it. It took dozens of hours of research and stitching together stories from news articles and people who had disclosed their experiences to me to make my talk, but I finally did it, and ever since UX Camp I‚Äôve had a lot of success with it.</p>\n<h3>What do you focus on speaking about?</h3>\n<p>My speaking is all about how technology enables domestic violence; how abusers can utilize technology to further their power and control over their victims, and how products that don‚Äôt enable abuse but are clearly spaces where survivors are taking certain actions that disclose the abuse and meaningful intervention could be provided (‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù is the preferred term instead over ‚Äúvictim‚Äù, since it speaks to the person‚Äôs ability to endure and survive a dangerous situation.)</p>\n<p>I tell a story about someone experiencing domestic violence in 5 different areas, give stats that correlate to those areas, and describe ways that more thoughtful design or building of the product could prevent the abuse. The 5 areas are financial abuse through online banking tools, harassment and monitoring through ‚Äúsmart‚Äù home devices/Internet of Things devices, stalking through GPS-enabled devices, personal security through software such as building management software, and how fitness, wellness, and pregnancy products could be a place of meaningful intervention.</p>\n<p>I think it goes without saying that domestic violence is a worthwhile thing to do a talk about, but just in case you need convincing, here are some stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 in 3 American women will experience severe physical abuse at the hands of an intimate partner.</li>\n<li>For men, that number is 1 in 4. Domestic violence is not an edge case.</li>\n<li>The number one cause of death among pregnant women in America is murder by her current or ex intimate partner.</li>\n<li>3 women are murdered by their current or ex intimate partners in America each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt see myself as a ‚Äúpublic speaker‚Äù - I really just want to spread the content of my talk because I think it‚Äôs really important.</p>\n<p>But I‚Äôve learned a few things: <strong>first, as someone who gets a lot of stage fright, the only thing that helps is just doing it a bunch.</strong> After 4 or 5 times talking a stage, it started to get a lot easier. After doing it a bunch and not dying, you start to realize it‚Äôs going to be ok. That‚Äôs the advice I give people who ask about speaking even though they‚Äôre not a natural public speaker - you have to just do it, but then it quickly gets a lot easier.</p>\n<p><strong>The second thing I like about speaking at conferences is that I also get to attend them!</strong> I think I‚Äôve grown in my career more rapidly than average in part because of attending half a dozen conferences in the past few months and learning a ton. My advice is to focus on applying to conferences you‚Äôd actually want to attend, so that they‚Äôre also a learning experience for you. I can only do so many conferences in a year, so I figure I might as well prioritize speaking at ones I also want to attend.</p>\n<p><strong>The third thing I like is that speaking at conferences unexpectedly helped with my social anxiety a lot.</strong> I‚Äôm introverted and socially anxious, but so many days of having strangers come up and talk to me about my talk, and share their experiences with violence, was the intense exposure I needed to start to get past my social anxiety. Within 6 months, I‚Äôve become so much more confident talking to strangers and being in new situations that would have induced a lot of anxiety in the past - all thanks to conference speaking. I really want people to know that you can be introverted, awkward, and socially anxious, and still be a great conference speaker and get a ton of benefit from doing it.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>7 so far, with a few more confirmed for the fall - include StrangeLoop, which I almost didn‚Äôt apply to because it seemed like such a long shot! I‚Äôve applied to about 40, and gotten 10 rejections, with the other 23 still up in the air.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhWPnKg4oK4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Eva PenzeyMoog: Designing Against Domestic Violence</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Deep breathing! And lots of practice, to the point that you don‚Äôt need to rely on speaker notes. It makes such a difference.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Two things:</p>\n<p><strong>You do NOT need to have the talk written before you write a proposal for that talk to apply to conferences with, and you do NOT need to already be an expert in the field that you‚Äôre proposing a talk about.</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling like you need to know and do so many things before even applying to something you might get rejected from is a surefire way to get overwhelmed and never start. Choose something you‚Äôre legitimately interested in and would want to become an expert in, write the proposal and apply to as many conferences as possible. Once you get accepted to one, then create the talk and learn all about it. You don‚Äôt need to present the answers in your proposal. I wish someone had spelled this out for me earlier on - I would have started applying with this talk a lot sooner!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie\">Sara Wachter-Boettcher</a> is a huge inspiration. She keeps it real - she‚Äôll call out the chatbot you‚Äôre using at your conference for defaulting to a woman‚Äôs name, and point out all the ways Facebook is terrible when a table full of Facebook designers is right in front of her. I really value that, and before her, had seen plenty of men behave that way, but no women. She‚Äôs not afraid to hold people accountable, but doesn‚Äôt make it personal. She strikes a perfect balance, and getting to see her speak and attend one of her workshops was incredibly valuable to see as I‚Äôm working on developing my own speaking style. I was lucky enough to randomly be seated with her at a shared table at a restaurant we were both at after I saw her talk at a conference, and got to ask her all my questions and get amazing advice. I think that was the moment I started to feel like the universe really wants me to do this work. Serendipitous things like that keep happening. And I‚Äôm trying to pay it forward - I‚Äôm all about getting more women and other underrepresented voices into the conference speaking circuit.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My website is <a href=\"https://evapenzeymoog.com/\">evapenzeymoog.com</a> and my Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/epenzeymoog\">@epenzeymoog</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Eva PenzeyMoog, Designer Helping Stamp Out Domestic Abuse","path":"/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/26","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PZhgAIc.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I started my career as a UX designer at a design agency. <strong>Being an introvert, I was very uncomfortable speaking in meetings and used to literally run away from having the spotlight on me.</strong> I even had a hard time speaking in front of my own team. Each time I stood up to talk I would get the classic symptoms such as dry mouth, profuse sweating, and forgetting what I wanted to say. It was frustrating because I noticed others who would get up and speak effortlessly and I wanted that for myself. I wanted to be able to get up and speak without hesitation and share my ideas.</p>\n<p>It was time to act.</p>\n<p>So I decided to turn things around and searched for ways to improve my public speaking skills. My search led me to a 30-day online speaking challenge which focused on specific areas in public speaking such as speed, filler words, pacing, etc. The last exercise of the challenge was to create a presentation of my own and record myself presenting it. At that time I was also diving into the world of sketching so I created a 5-minute talk about sketching journey. To test out my presentation I needed real people to present it to so I searched for meetups and found a developer meetup which was looking for presenters for their next meetup. Their CFP page was very inviting towards new speakers which gave me the confidence to apply. I jumped on the chance and submitted my talk proposal and that‚Äôs when my public speaking journey began.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>For me, it‚Äôs all about the people. Whether it‚Äôs someone who connects with my message or another speaker who is just starting out, I love meeting new people and making friends at conferences.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don‚Äôt know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of speaking at conferences is that each conference brings its own challenges such as room layouts, the acoustics of rooms, the size of the audience, the distance to the audience, lighting, etc. these all present challenges that help us grow.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first conference talk very clearly because it was started out a bit rough. I was really nervous before the event because I didn‚Äôt know anyone in the sea of people. The layout of the room I was presenting it was a bit challenging. There was a big column right in the middle of the room which divided the audience into two sides. The windows were from floor to ceiling which sounds nice but made it extremely difficult to see my slides. We had to turn off the lights to be able to see them so I presented my talk in the dark, talk about throwing you off your game. As I began my presentation I noticed the people in the audience with their expressionless stares which made me think I was boring them. This started the negative self-talk in my head while I was presenting which never turns out well and it caused me to read my slides instead of looking at the audience. Towards the end, I felt much better and more in control of my talk. After the event, I felt a bit disheartened but I was determined to learn from the events of the day and improve for the next time.</p>\n<p>Each new talk presents challenges and opportunities to learn from and to help us grow. I am still learning from my ‚Äúmis-takes‚Äù and addressing the areas I need to improve in. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that public speaking is a continuous learning process. Never stop learning.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/REn0gvq.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I haven‚Äôt kept count but I know I have applied to many conferences. My CFP rejected-to-win ratio is probably around 0.00001 which is definitely an exercise in learning how to accept rejection and not take it personally.</p>\n<p>I have presented at 6 conferences in the US and in Europe. My talk recently was accepted at a conference in Oslo which improves the ratio just a little bit.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>A week before my talk, my routine consists of getting a fresh haircut and picking out the outfit I will wear. I also make sure I have all the dongles, adapters, cables, remotes I need.</p>\n<p>On the day of the talk, I make sure I have a good breakfast and pack a few snacks just in case I get hungry before the talk.</p>\n<p>If I am speaking at a conference, I make sure to scope out the room I will be presenting in beforehand to check out the stage and seating arrangements. This way I can visualize myself up on the stage presenting beforehand, which help me feel prepared.</p>\n<p>Right before giving my talk I will do some breathing exercises, and if I really need to get pumped up then I will find stairs nearby and go up and down them quickly to warm up and get my blood flowing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>I recommend new speakers look for opportunities to present at work, meetups, schools, basically anywhere they can.</strong> At work, you can present at a Lunch and Learn session. Don‚Äôt have a Lunch and Learn session at work? Why not start one? This will give you the opportunity to present regularly and get more practice. Meetup organizers are always looking for new people to present and share their ideas. You can also start off with Lightning Talks which are short 5-minute presentations on any topic you want and are a great entry point to start your public speaking journey.</p>\n<p>Another tip I like to share is to make your talk interactive. <strong>Find ways to get your audience engaged with your message through exercises, questions, or discussions.</strong> Getting the audience involved will help them connect with your message on a deeper level and when the audience is engaged I notice that I relax more and become less anxious since.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Inspiration is everywhere. Whether it‚Äôs a team member presenting at work, a speaker at a conference, or kids presenting at an elementary school, I find inspiration by observing people and how they communicate. I have presented my talks at elementary schools and I‚Äôm especially inspired by the confidence kids have in standing up and sharing their ideas without hesitation which is something I am working towards.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>A good thing about having a somewhat unique name is that if you Google Rizwan Javaid, I will show up.

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Like many speakers I‚Äôve interviewed, Mike Miles understands that working in technology is about much more than just writing\ncode. While he has done plenty of that, Mike started speaking to raise his confidence and force himself to learn something new.\nNow, in addition to speaking at dozens of conferences, Mike hosts a podcast called Developing Up, which covers a wide range of\nnon-technical topics for software developers. We spoke about some of the <a href=\"https://www.developingup.com/episodes/43\">advantages of public speaking</a>\nfor your career on the show, but in this interview, Mike goes into some of his tips and the opportunities that speaking\nhas afforded him as well.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>Since 2009 I have worked at <a href=\"https://www.wearegenuine.com/\">Genuine, a full service digital agency headquartered in Boston MA, USA</a>. My current role is V.P. of Development, which entails leading the development department and the individuals in it. My day ranges anywhere from meeting with clients, building project estimates to fixing bugs, building features or leading technical architecture for a client project.</p>\n<p>I first got into public speaking by presenting lightning talks at local technology meetups. I started by asking development questions, presenting about projects I was working on and demoing solutions I had built. <strong>As an introverted person I was nervous about getting in front of and speaking to a large group of people.</strong> I knew for myself and for progression in my career, public speaking was something I wanted to improve on.</p>\n<p>In 2013 I started submitting talks to conferences and forced myself into the deep-end.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LLmOZiu.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Submitting talks is a great excuse to learn something new.</strong> When I submit a talk proposal it‚Äôs usually on a topic that I am not an expert on, but one that I am interested in learning more about. I then have a motivator to deep dive into the topic to learn about it. This has the challenge of learning enough about a topic to be able to present it in a way that others can understand.</p>\n<p>For technical talks in particular, this means being able to break down the subject into basic terms and concepts. This practice has come in very helpful for my career and day job interacting with clients. Being able to explain technical issues or aspects of your project in simple ways is very helpful for improving communication abilities.</p>\n<p>More self-serving is the added benefit of being able to travel to different locations around the world to present talks. Most technical conferences will cover the ticket cost (and sometimes airfare and lodging) for speakers. This affords me the opportunity to visit places I may not be able to on my own and get introduced to new communities of people. The benefit to my career from this is that I‚Äôm able to grow my professional network. As well as, I have opportunities to listen to a large range of talks by other great speakers.</p>\n<p>Finally there is the benefit of building up my self confidence. <strong>The more I present the more confident I become in my abilities to do so.</strong> This has helped with my social anxiety and with my ability to interact with clients or potential clients. Thanks to my years of public speaking I am now not afraid to join in on conversations with little or no preparations and be confident in what I am going to say.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was in June 2013 at the conference Design 4 Drupal, hosted at MIT in Cambridge MA. I co-presented with a co-worker on responsive design in a talk titled ‚ÄúBumps in the Road to Responsive‚Äù.</p>\n<p>As it was my first time speaking in front of a large group, I remember being very nervous about it. To prepare for the talk my co-presenter and I printed out scripts of exactly what we were going to say. Then we practiced many, many times, all the way up until the hour before our scheduled time slot. I do not remember much about presenting (it was all a blur), but we made it through it. People stayed through the whole thing and we had many follow up hallway conversations - which means attendees took away something helpful.</p>\n<p>My second time presenting and first time presenting solo, was in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-RQxA4JH6w\">April 2014 at a conference hosted at the UN building in New York City</a>. Again, I was very nervous about presenting and spent weeks rehearsing my talk. I had moved away from printing out a script and relied on having practiced my talk. That did not help my nerves and I remember hyperventilating, and my hands shaking. Yet I managed to get through it and covered all the points I wanted to talk about. I even managed to throw in a few (bad) jokes in my talk. At the end, I was very proud of what I accomplished and how I managed to present on my topic.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-RQxA4JH6w' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Mike Miles, ‚ÄúTo Patch Contrib or Write a Custom Module‚Äù</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since 2013, I have applied to 40 different conferences a majority of which have been tech focused. Of those 40 I have spoken at 34 conferences, presenting 38 talks on 9 different subjects. This has given me a chance to present at conference in 4 different countries (US, Canada, Iceland &#x26; Germany). On average I build about 1 - 2 new technical topics a year, and present each at 5 - 6 different conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>After every presentation I take time reflect on how well I did and think of ways I can improve my process. This has lead to an evolution of a pre-talk routine that works for me.</p>\n<p>My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. <strong>I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I present my talk to a brick wall and yes it looks and feels awkward, but that is the point.</p>\n<p>I practice the way I‚Äôll present the talk to work out the quirks and get the flow correct. By the time I‚Äôve spent a week doing this, presenting my talk becomes muscle memory. I then do not have to worry about what I‚Äôm going to say and can instead focus on how I‚Äôm saying it. This allows me to react to any audience questions and manage my allotted time. This is the most important part of my pre-talk of my routine. After this time I DO NOT edit my presentation, doing so would only throw everything off.</p>\n<p>The day before and day of my talk I prepare my body. <strong>I start by making sure to get to bed at a respectable time and get a full night‚Äôs rest.</strong></p>\n<p>The morning of I have a good breakfast and if possible practice one last time. The hardest part of this phase is that I do not drink any coffee or caffeine leading up to my talk. <strong>I have found that since I still get nervous any caffeine over activates my nerves and leads to me speaking quickly and being shaky during my talk.</strong> I also use the day before / morning of to prepare backups of my presentation. I create a PDF version (that I can then share with the audience), back up to a cloud service, create a short link and if possible place it on a USB device. This way if anything catastrophic happens to my laptop or the internet goes down, I can still give my talk.</p>\n<p>The hour before my talk I spend clearing my mind. I‚Äôll take a break from the conference I‚Äôm at, take a small walk and focus my mind on nothing. This time gives me a chance to calm down and relax. Fifteen minutes before my talk I find the room I‚Äôll be presenting in (if I have not already done so) and sit in on the talk currently being given (if there is one).</p>\n<p>Then it‚Äôs time for me to get on stage, hook up my laptop and start talking!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you do not have to be an expert to present on a technical topic.</strong> Build a presentation around an interest. You do not have to be a subject matter expert and building a talk is a great motivator to learn something new.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>practice, practice, practice and practice out loud!</strong> You will not get a feel for your talk by practicing it ‚Äúin your head‚Äù. Practice the way you present your talk. Standing up, hooked up to a monitor and not facing your slides. This allows you to build a muscle memory around what and how you are going to present.</p>\n<p>Third, when possible <strong>practice your talk in front of a trusted friend or family.</strong> Ideally someone who is not knowledgeable of the material. They will catch things about your presentation that you are not aware of and give you helpful feedback on the story you are telling. I cannot tell you the number of spelling and grammar mistakes my wife has found in my presentations.</p>\n<p>Fourth, <strong>do not be the person that edits your presentation hours/minutes leading up to your talk.</strong> Doing so means you are going to have to figure out what you want say while presenting. Losing the message / lesson you want to convey to your audience.</p>\n<p>Number five is <strong>do not be afraid to submit your talk to many conferences.</strong> You do not need to build a new talk for every CFP and the information you‚Äôve built will be beneficial for many audiences. Plus the more times you give your talk the better you will become at it.</p>\n<p>Finally, number six, <strong>mistakes will happen and when they do move on.</strong> I‚Äôve seen some technical talks derailed because the presenter spent too long trying to get a code example to work, or wait for a file to load due to a bad internet connection. If something is not going correct, move on to the next part of your talk, your audience will thank you.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers who I have looked up to and have inspired my career as a technical speaker. The first is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Crell\">Larry Garfield</a>. Larry outlined the methods he‚Äôs used to build technical talks and his guidelines. These have helped me numerous times to build session proposals that have been accepted by conferences. <a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">You can read Larry‚Äôs guidelines here</a>.</p>\n<p>The second speaker is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eaton\">Jeff Eaton</a>. Every time I have seen Jeff present, it is with enthusiasm and passion for what he is presenting on. As an attendee at one of his talks you feel this in the way he presents and you walk away feeling empowered (at least this has been my experience). The way Jeff Eaton presents is something I have striven to replicate in my own presentation style.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Interested readers can find out more about me in a number of different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can hear my voice monthly as the <a href=\"https://www.developingup.com\">host of the Developing Up podcast</a> - a podcast that is focused on the non-technical side of being a developer and growing a career in development.</li>\n<li>I can be found on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devuppodcast\">@devuppodcast</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemiles86\">@mikemiles86</a>.</li>\n<li>All of my previous technical talks and upcoming speaking engagements can be found on my website at <a href=\"http://www.mike-miles.com\">www.mike-miles.com</a>.</li>\n<li>And I‚Äôm always happy to connect on LinkedIn at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/\">linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Mike Miles, Podcaster Focused on the Nontechnical Side of Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-mike-miles/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/16","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aiVLNLBPbgjq_2LlEvHL4MzyfKpIB_DT"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

One thing I love about speaking is getting to attend conferences and hear other talks - especially from subject-matter experts who are truly passionate about their craft. Bailey is one of those passionate people, and I‚Äôm excited to bring you her story here today.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm director of content strategy at usability consulting firm <a href=\"https://truematter.com/\">truematter</a> out of Columbia, South Carolina. I‚Äôm a user experience content strategist which means I plan, organize, and write the words people use to interact with websites, applications, and software products. I‚Äôve been involved in public speaking throughout my life, especially when I was younger.</p>\n<p>Recently, I felt a call to pick it up again for many reasons but one in particular: design and development teams must change their approach to words online. Many, many organizations (including those that should know better) still write their online content the same way they would for traditional media. That approach drags down their product‚Äôs user experience, makes it harder for customers to engage with them online, and has a large negative impact on the success of their digital products. I set out to speak out about this widespread problem and how we should fix it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l6UnYFz.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm still pretty new on the conference scene but even so, <strong>I‚Äôve already made a lot of connections with both people in my field and those outside of it.</strong> I think it‚Äôs a lot easier to meet people when you‚Äôre the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time ‚Äì a real plus for an introvert like me.</p>\n<p>Also, I‚Äôve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places ‚Äì I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It went well! I think I was surprised when I found out that people do actually care a great deal about their digital content and want to know how to make it better and more usable. The audience had a ton of questions, which was great. The whole thing is kind of addicting. You experience it once and think, ‚ÄúI want to do that again.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve spoken at about ten events so far with another four or five already scheduled for later this year.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to a lot more than that for sure. I probably send out three applications a month and that number has been growing lately. But <strong>the more I apply and the more I speak, the more conferences are approaching me instead of the other way around and that‚Äôs a really nice feeling.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATVKZdl_pEw?start=130' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Bailey Lewis at OKC Design Tech</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I always try to see the space before I speak in it. That could mean swinging by the room before my presentation or trying to find a video of a presentation someone else gave in that room online. Seeing the space before my presentation lets me decide where to stand and helps me understand how the audience will be looking at my slides (one big screen? multiple screens around the room? etc).</p>\n<p>Other than that, <strong>I take a deep breath and remind myself: The audience came to see me present on this topic.</strong> They want it to go well as much as I do. And that‚Äôs a lot more helpful than imagining them in their underwear.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>If you‚Äôre brand new, it might be hard to find speaking gigs that will cover your travel and accommodations. The conference might even ask you to pay to attend even though you‚Äôre speaking (not my favorite practice but there you have it).</p>\n<p>Take a few of these gigs if you need to so you can get started and get your name out there, but as soon as someone offers to cover your travel/accommodations, demand it every time you speak afterward. Even better if you can throw a speaker stipend into the mix. That will probably mean saying no to conferences you‚Äôd really like to speak at, which can be painful. But once you reach certain level in your speaking career, you shouldn‚Äôt be digging in your own pockets when you‚Äôre the one providing the presentation content that will sell conference tickets and make the event successful.</p>\n<p>By the way, <strong>I love that CFP Land lists which ‚Äúperks‚Äù each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don‚Äôt have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I‚Äôm expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.</strong></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure about specific conference speakers (although there are presentations I‚Äôve really enjoyed), but my father is a trial attorney and, among other speaking-related lessons, he taught me the art of giving a presentation without swaying or fidgeting. He would record me giving a presentation and then have me watch it back ‚Äì it was extremely effective for getting rid of the fidgets.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Find me at <a href=\"https://truematter.com/baileylewis\">truematter.com/baileylewis</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>When I was in college, I was paralyzed by the fear of public speaking. Just the thought of talking in front of a small class would cause cold-sweats. Fortunately, I was studying for a career in Comp Sci. which usually doesn‚Äôt require much public speaking.</p>\n<p>Once my career began, I was reaffirmed, no one wants to hear a developer speak. That was fine for a few years, and then new nagging energy began. People can‚Äôt listen if you don‚Äôt speak. Quietly interjecting important points without ever taking the lead of a conversation is less effective than not speaking at all. It was time to start breaking out of my shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Though I was uncomfortable, I started speaking up more and more.</strong> I attended conferences, and I marveled at speakers. I was amazed, but sure I would never be on the other side of the 4th wall.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can‚Äôt shut me up. It‚Äôs always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn‚Äôt comfortable, but it‚Äôs doable. Now <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">you can see I‚Äôve been speaking actively for years</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm very fortunate that I work for the great people at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a> who have supported me from lightning talk to keynote speaker.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>The best thing about speaking at conferences is the networking and connection. I‚Äôve made friends around the world.</strong> This has, directly AND indirectly, benefited my career and employer. It‚Äôs not required in my job description, but it‚Äôs valuable to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts. I‚Äôm still an introvert, but it doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, something like that feels great. The community and positivity of it all is superb!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>After a lot of Toastmasters, and speaking at a local meetup, my first ‚Äúconference‚Äù talk was a lightning slot at RubyConf 2013.</p>\n<p>How‚Äôd it go?

It was fun. üôÇ</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUIcTl9Hto4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tejas presenting ‚ÄúPapercuts Can Kill‚Äù at TEDx</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I‚Äôve applied to like 20 and spoken at like 9? It‚Äôs a gut feeling though. I have no real idea.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I often put myself into the mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve won‚Äù already before I even play.</strong> This gives me hope and like prepares me to do an amazing job. Eventually, it somehow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Odd, maybe, but it works for me every time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You‚Äôd be surprised by how much value you can add with a talk. Our tech industry today is so full of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1126096390281732097\">faux confidence and pretend knowledge</a> that one would often feel like they don‚Äôt know enough ‚Äì I know I feel this way most of the time. The truth is, I actually know quite a bit <em>in my own, very specific area</em> that I can use to educate and help others who aren‚Äôt as familiar with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôm often insecure about kubernetes, data structures and algorithms, and CS fundamentals because I personally was always too sick to get a Computer Science degree. I don‚Äôt have one. I am a prime example of impostor syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, I feel there are just as many people insecure about React, TypeScript, CSS and other areas. I rejoice at the idea of combating their impostor syndrome with my experience in these subjects. For me, this is part of the joy of public speaking along these themes.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve always been extremely uncomfortable with my <em>content</em> not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I‚Äôve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to better my technical abilities to ‚Äúclose the loop‚Äù.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been inspired by a lot of speakers, inside and outside of tech circles. I especially appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweststrate\">Michel Weststrate</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a>‚Äôs speaking styles as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darcar31\">Daria Caraway</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm most active on twitter under <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tejaskumar_\">@tejaskumar_</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>During the day I‚Äôm a senior software engineer at a company called MoreCommerce where we do small and medium-sized business e-commerce and market place offerings. Outside of that, I help maintain various API related OSS projects like Fractal, openapi.tools, standards.rest and a few others. I spend most of my free time doing photography or cycling.</p>\n<p>As for speaking, I got my start at my old PHP user group in Atlanta. I started with a lightning talk and moved up to a full-length talk before breaking into a conference. Im usually pretty shy and quiet, so it was weird at first but it been a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about speaking is <strong>it‚Äôs an excuse to learn and play with new technology</strong>. I wouldn‚Äôt have become passionate about the OpenAPI spec if a conference hadn‚Äôt given me a chance to speak on it for example. And because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, <strong>giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn‚Äôt touch at work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It feels so long ago, but my first talk was at a now-defunct conference called ‚ÄúGreat Wide Open‚Äù. I submitted a talk essentially about why community is awesome and how it can help someone learn. Since it was my first talk I was incredibly nervous but somehow I pulled it off. I got good feedback for it, and felt like I could have massaged it a bit into a more full talk.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>This year I will have spoken at 5, including 2 (maybe 3) keynotes. That‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever done. Last year I spoke at one conference.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I usually put on some music, like Run The Jewels and just zone out.</strong> I tend not to sit in a talk before my slot so I can keep my thoughts going. Everyone is different, what works for me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll work for someone else. I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing. I‚Äôm also bad in that I will still be doing slides up until my talk. I should fix that.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For your first talk, <strong>pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgable about.</strong> Don‚Äôt experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.</p>\n<p>When you submit your CFP, check your spelling and grammar. It‚Äôs amazing how many people overlook it.</p>\n<p>Another thing is <strong>don‚Äôt immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, submit multiple submissions, it gives you better odds. When we organized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/southeastphp\">Southeast PHP</a>, people with multiple submissions had a better shot getting into our post-apocalyptic Thunderdome over someone who only gave us one thing to choose.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I‚Äôm thrilled to bring you Drishti‚Äôs story today, and hope it inspires you to get out and do some good in the world!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w36pjbN.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I am Drishti Jain a Computer Engineer at heart and a technology enthusiast. I love to use technology to help the less fortunate. I am a social entrepreneur. I am the Co-founder and President of the non-profit organisation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samyakdrishtifoundation\">Samyak Drishti Foundation</a> which works in environment, education and healthcare sectors in 10 cities across India. I have been titled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoptimistcitizen/p/BdT0mVJnMhU/\">Eco-Warrior thrice by the Government of Maharashtra, India</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been a good orator since a young age. I got into public speaking at school in grade 4; when I had to give a speech on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (for his birth anniversary). Ever since, I‚Äôve loved the stage and sharing knowledge with all. Fun Fact: I also host music concerts sometimes :)</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences about things that I am passionate about. While I continue to learn new things and develop myself, I like to share my learning with others. Speaking at conferences, I am sharing with everyone about how cool a technology is or how I make the most of a feature. It gives me immense satisfaction to share my knowledge with all.</p>\n<p>I have learnt a lot speaking at conferences. I would like to share my secret weapon to effectively speaking in front large audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>My secret weapon ‚Äì the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause.</strong> These are three key parts of speaking effectively at conferences. Using this paradigm, I am able to more effectively deliver my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Moreover, speaking at conferences I am able to share my learning with all and give them a head start in the technology. I am believer of ‚ÄúLearning by sharing Knowledge‚Äù and speaking at conferences just fuels that!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was an exciting experience. Post deciding my topic (after a lot of brainstorming) I realized that I had just entered the long hiking trail of preparing my talk, yet to embark. There was a mountain of information I had gathered through research on the topic. And I had to create my talk in a way that I would cover maximum information and make it interesting. <strong>It all seemed overwhelming at first; but I decide to sit and create a summary of the information, that made it easy to prepare my talk.</strong></p>\n<p>On the day of the conference, I reached the venue early and checked if my laptop was compatible with the system; it was all ok and I was set to present my talk. Having reached early, I got comfortable with the environment and eagerly waited for my talk slot.</p>\n<p>I gave my talk and had a good Q and A for my talk; which gave me the assurance and satisfaction that I presented well and attendees were listening keenly.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing experience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Considering events, workshops, tech talks, conferences I have spoken at about 30-40; including a few virtual speaking engagements.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I attend the talk before my talk to set into the energy of the conference hall. <strong>I also do a demo practice with a friend to gain feedback.</strong></p>\n<p>I feel enthusiastic over nervous before my talk. I believe I have learned to convert my nervous energy into enthusiasm by practicing before my talk. I know it can be difficult due to packed schedules of the conference and work; but I do make sure to make time to practice. Sometimes I skim through my talk contents or rehearse the complete talk depending on the time I can make in my schedule.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I will encourage new speakers to speak about what they are truly passionate about. <strong>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present.</strong> It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!</p>\n<p>If you feel crunching everything you love about the topic into the 30/45 min talk is getting on to you, <strong>go outside and have fresh air. It will help you have a clear head and invoke creativity in your talk.</strong> It is very trivial to know the audience you will be presenting for. Most importantly remember to be yourself and be excited to share with the world what you like about the technology.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I got inspired by the talk by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pranavmistry\">Pranav Mistry</a> on the Sixth-Sense technology. I liked how he presented the technology and included components in the talk that could be understood by someone new in the technology space. It has inspired me to include an overview of concepts related to my topic in the beginning of my talk for a couple of minutes, so that a participant novice to the topic understands the overall picture and doesn‚Äôt feel left out.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrtANPtnhyg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>TEDIndia: The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology by Pranav Mistry</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am active on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drishtijjain\">@drishtijjain</a>.

What‚Äôs impressive to me is how quickly Kara has embraced her new career and been able to help others by giving talks at conferences and meetups. As Kara points out in this week‚Äôs Speaker‚Äôs Story, speaking is a great way to bolster your career and encourage others in the field.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into tech and eventually public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zFT1aBg.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I had a weird path to tech. I pursued a career as a professional ballerina for a long time. I even moved to New York City by myself at 17 to train full-time with the Joffrey Ballet School. I really loved ballet but I realized that I‚Äôd be lucky if I could make my career last until I was 30 due to all of the strain it puts on your body.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs when I decided to take a break from ballet, move back to my hometown of Nashville, TN, and go to college. I majored in public relations with a music business minor and was one of the lucky few to land a job in the music industry after I graduated.</p>\n<p>I absolutely loved working as a music publicist. It was a very glamorous job but also a highly stressful one and I was getting burnt out pretty quickly. I knew I needed a change and started looking into other career paths when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">CodeCademy</a>. I really enjoyed the feeling of solving an error and decided that I wanted to make the leap to tech so I enrolled in The Iron Yard‚Äôs front end engineering bootcamp. Fast forward almost three years later and I‚Äôm still loving life in the tech world. I‚Äôm currently working as an engineer on the UX team at <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\">CrowdStrike</a>.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely benefited my career. It‚Äôs allowed me to expand my network in ways that I‚Äôve never imagined before!</p>\n<p>I got into conference speaking first by writing blog posts which eventually led to speaking at local meetups and then conferences. I like that by speaking at conferences I can help others learn. <strong>It‚Äôs really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I‚Äôm talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn‚Äôt before.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I gave my first conference talk not too long ago! Big shout out to CodeStock for allowing me the opportunity. I‚Äôm really happy with the way my talk turned out. I talk fast naturally and talk even faster when I‚Äôm nervous so I was worried that my 60-minute time slot would end up being closer to 20 minutes. I took my time and a couple deep breaths and managed to use up most of my allotted time though!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm still pretty new to the speaker circuit so I‚Äôve only applied to around eight conferences. I‚Äôve spoken at one so far and am currently on the waitlist for another. <strong>I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. I‚Äôm learning from each rejection I get.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt like to attend a session before my talk as I like to take that time to be by myself and compose my thoughts. I‚Äôll typically run through my slides one last time but I‚Äôll only do a visual run through - I won‚Äôt actually practice. I also like to take a minute or two to go somewhere on my own and give myself a little pep talk!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Go for it! You can never succeed if you don‚Äôt try.</strong> Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and don‚Äôt give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really love watching Chloe Condon‚Äôs talks. I love how she injects humor into them.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n3GHyWTaM8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Chloe Condon at DevXcon, 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

Like many speakers, George is an experienced software developer who‚Äôs passionate about mentoring and teaching newcomers to the field. In this week‚Äôs interview, hear more about how speaking at over 20 conferences so far has helped take George‚Äôs career to the next level.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://georgemandis.s3.amazonaws.com/holyjs-piter-2017/me-holy-js.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">George Mandis</a>. I‚Äôm currently a full stack, independent web developer at <a href=\"https://snaptortoise.com/\">SnapTortoise</a> based out of Portland, Oregon, though I wear quite a few other hats. I‚Äôve been freelancing for 13 years, but over the past 4 or 5 years I‚Äôve gravitated towards mentorship roles. Teaching classes, workshops, leading bootcamps and working with junior developers one-on-one has been a rewarding experience and speaking feels like a natural extension to this.</p>\n<p>My first foray into speaking was actually at an Ignite event in Portland where I summarized, in 5 minutes, my experience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2QC43jwPyM\">living as a digital nomad</a> for a year. I was terrified to speak in front of so many people, but it went well! After that I though I should look into conference speaking as a way to advance myself professionally, extend the aforementioned mentoring activities I mentioned and continue to travel and see the world, which is one my biggest passions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2QC43jwPyM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things ‚Äî not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!</strong></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs always interesting to me to see one type of work or technology in-demand in one place and find it barely mentioned at all in another. It‚Äôs also nice to humanize other developers and put a face and a personality to a name. These conferences also have a tendency to be expensive and difficult to otherwise attend, as an independent developer. Being able to attend these conferences and pick the brain of people who work at some very large, influential tech companies is a wonderful opportunity.</p>\n<p>I think the process of preparing a talk and speaking in front of a large group people could benefit anyone‚Äôs career, but for mine it‚Äôs certainly opened some doors. <strong>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.</strong></p>\n<p>The other benefit of speaking is I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a great opportunity to talk about the things you want to be doing, even if it‚Äôs not the thing you‚Äôre necessarily doing in your day-to-day. My talks tend to focus on creativity, art, hardware-dabbling and making interesting, outside-the-box projects through JavaScript. Speaking on these topics has allowed me to spend more time immersed in that world and meet other like-minded and very talented people with similar interests.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My very first ‚Äútalk‚Äù was the 5-minute Ignite talk I mentioned earlier, but my first <em>technical</em> talk was at HolyJS in Russia. I remember applying to a number of conferences by that point in the year. Some had accepted me but had no budget for travel, but HolyJS was the first one where everything lined up.</p>\n<p>The idea of talking for a full hour was incredibly daunting ‚Äî I‚Äôd never done that before! When I pulled up the conference website I became even more nervous ‚Äî David Crockford and Lea Verou were two developers I‚Äôd read and followed for most of my career, and they were head-lining the conference! My attitude going in was, <strong>if this goes terribly, at least I‚Äôm 2000 miles from home and probably won‚Äôt ever run into any of these people again.</strong> It sounds funny, but it really took the pressure off!</p>\n<p>Fortunately it went well, and I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôve seen several familiar faces from that conference at other conferences since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure I could put a number on the number I‚Äôve applied to. I‚Äôve spoken at something around 20 now, but can guarantee you <strong>my acceptance rate is in the single digits, percentage-wise.</strong> Like most opportunities, it really is a numbers game. You have to be diligent and persistent, but also mindful of how you might be able to tweak your proposals to better suit a particular conference‚Äôs theme.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>If I have time a day or two before the conference <strong>I like to walk to the venue from wherever I‚Äôm staying so that I‚Äôm not thinking too hard about finding it on the day I present.</strong> In the hours leading up to the presentation I practice saying key sentences and takeaways for specific slides as I go through the slide from beginning to end, over and over, and make sure all my demos work. Once it‚Äôs about 30-minutes or so to go I‚Äôll put the slides away and just try to clear my head. This routine changes depending on how new the talk is and how comfortable I‚Äôm feeling with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I also try to see as many other talks as I can</strong>, though I that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming. After I‚Äôve given my talk I‚Äôm much more relaxed and find it easier to enjoy the other talks. I try to make a point of shaking hands with all the speakers I see and letting them know I really appreciated what they spoke on. Other speakers might have differing opinions on that, but I know I genuinely appreciate it when someone in the audience comes up to me just to let me know they enjoyed my talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>When it comes to applying <strong>it really is a numbers game.</strong></p>\n<p>Apply early and often and try not to get too down on yourself if your talk isn‚Äôt accepted. For topics, there are many schools of thought on this, but I personally feel sharing a case study or story about how you used a particular piece of technology to achieve a specific goal is a good approach for giving your talk structure. Talking about why technology X is cool in general way can be just fine, but sharing how we used X at Y to achieve Z gives the audience something more concrete to walk away with.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre giving a workshop you can dive more deeply into the nitty-gritty workings of a thing and keep your focus there, but in a 20-40 minutes talk it‚Äôs more about introducing an idea and making the case for why others should have interest in it.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are quite a few, but I‚Äôll mention two people I met at my very first talk who I think are wonderful: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/g33konaut\">Martin Splitt</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GLa6cwP.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a software engineer from Kansas City, Missouri. I love to tech, and I love to share the cool things I‚Äôve learned with other people.</p>\n<p>I have always enjoyed going to schools to speak to students, but I was intrigued by conference speaking. One fateful evening I told <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a>, founder of Kansas City Women in Technology, that I was interested in speaking at tech conferences. She volunteered to be my mentor, set me up with resources for writing abstracts, and she sent me links to open CFPs for various conferences for me to begin submitting those abstracts. It felt like a whirlwind of events‚Ä¶I was writing abstracts the first week of December 2018, submitting those to conferences within the next week, and I got my first acceptance in January!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I‚Äôm providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.</p>\n<p>I do believe it has benefited my career, and it has helped me to shine a light on the things I believe are great.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference was DevFest KC this past February in Kansas City. <strong>I was super nervous, and I told the audience this was my first time speaking at a conference. I‚Äôm used to trying to engage small groups of teenagers, not 20-40 adults.</strong> However, I needn‚Äôt have worried so much. My audience was engaged, they asked questions, and they were eager to participate. By the end of the talk, they didn‚Äôt believe that was my first time.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312227563\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          \n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/312227563\">Rhia Dixon at the KC Women in Technology 2019 Kickoff</a></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>At the time of this response, I have applied to 28 conferences. Thus far, I have been accepted to speak at 6 of the 16 conferences that have announced their speakers (1 of which I‚Äôve already done).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine consists of taking one last look at my slides, a few deep breaths, and listening to whatever song that currently has my ears hostage (typically something upbeat and relatively positive with great musicality).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I would pass on some of the best advice I‚Äôve received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a topic that you wouldn‚Äôt mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.</li>\n<li>Write your abstract in such a way that the reader gets a pretty good understanding of why they should be at your talk and what they will get from attending.</li>\n<li>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you‚Äôve got friends in the audience ‚Äî some you may know, and some you may not know‚Ä¶yet.</li>\n<li>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts ‚Äî <strong>I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.</strong> I‚Äôve found this particularly helpful for tweaking my abstracts and tailoring my talks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I currently work at Comcast where I am the lead web developer for xFi. My first public presentation was at a Sass meetup in Philadelphia in 2012 where I volunteered to talk about a new open source project I was working on. From there I spoke at a few ‚Äúunconferences‚Äù &#x26; ‚Äúunconference tracks‚Äù at other conferences (where basically as long as you show up and there‚Äôs an open speaking slot, it‚Äôs yours) before I was first accepted to speak at a conference.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxfoundation/44425350705/in/faves-17844497@N00/\">The Linux Foundation, some rights reserved</a></em></p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The thing I enjoy the most is sharing my experiences, both on stage and in the conversations with attendees afterwards. It has also allowed me to travel to some fun and interesting places.</p>\n<p>There are a couple areas where it has directly benefited my career. <strong>I was given the opportunity to <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Sass-Converting-Existing-Site/434463-2.html\">create a course for Lynda.com</a> because I met Lynda.com staff author <a href=\"http://www.raybo.org/\">Ray Villalobos</a> after we both spoke at a conference.</strong> It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray. In addition, at my current role at Comcast I am expected to be having an impact outside of the company, and public speaking is the path I‚Äôve been leaning on to accomplish that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I was accepted to speak at via a CFP was the University of Illinois Web Conference in 2015. When I talked to folks that attended afterwards, everyone had good things to say, but given it was my first talk I essentially took that as I did not too anything terribly wrong, which was a great first step.</p>\n<p>My favorite talk I‚Äôve given so far is ‚ÄúThe Critical Career Path Conversation‚Äù which I premiered at The Lead Developer NYC in 2018. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLBzScQzZ83I8H8_0Qete6Bs5EcW3p0kZF&#x26;v=hMz6QDURQOM\">view it on YouTube</a>, including a fun glitch about one-third of the way through for you all to enjoy watching me struggle &#x26; recover from.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMz6QDURQOM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to about 70 so far and spoken at 20.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it üòú.</p>\n<p>I usually spend the hour before looking and my slide notes one last time and inevitably tweak a few things here or there. My system is to write out what I‚Äôm planning to say for each slide in the slide notes but then I rarely ever follow it directly once I start talking. It‚Äôs just a comfort feeling knowing that if I totally forget what I was going to say, the script is there.</p>\n<p>The last thing I do, which I do recommend, is to <strong>make sure you start off smiling</strong> üòÉ.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is so much I could say here but I‚Äôll limit it to a few quick hits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Imposter syndrome is real and a totally normal feeling</strong>, so do not let that hold you back. Especially early on, I always had a feeling of ‚Äúeveryone in the audience will already know what I‚Äôm talking about.‚Äù That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During the intro of your talk, let the audience know how you intend to take questions (raise your hand during the talk, hold them until the end, chat in the hallway later, email, etc.). If someone asks a question that you don‚Äôt know the answer to, it is much better to say ‚ÄúThat is a great question. I don‚Äôt know what the answer is so let me get back to you,‚Äù than to try to make up an answer on the spot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My CFP acceptance rate went up when I internalized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344\">this piece of advice from Fluent organizer Kyle Simpson</a>:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/advice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#advice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/designingATalk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#designingATalk</a><br><br>OK talks are about the topic.<br><br>Good talks are about the speaker/presentation.<br><br>Great talks are about the audience.</p>&mdash; getify (@getify) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are 2 in particular that I look up to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://meowni.ca/\">Monica Dinculescu</a> because when it comes to technical knowledge, she does an excellent job of taking a topic and distilling it down so that the audience can understand it and apply it immediately. She is able to do it while keeping her talk entertaining with healthy doses of humor and emojis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agiledeveloper.com/\">Venkat Subramaniam</a> is a marathon speaker that I am amazed by. He is a superhuman when it comes to learning new content and teaching it. At the last conference I spoke at, Venkat delivered a full day workshop on the first day and then gave a talk at literally every possible speaking slot over the course of the next 3 days, which totaled 13 separate 90 minute talks. The thing that amazes me even more (especially given my typical pre-talk routine) is he has no slides. He starts off each talk with some bullet point topics in a text editor and the magic happens from there.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>I tweet infrequently at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnriv?lang=en\">@JohnRiv</a>. In the middle of July I‚Äôll be at <a href=\"https://uberconf.com\">√úberConf</a> in Denver running a full-day workshop on Web Components and giving a couple talks in the days that follow.

Read on to learn more about his process and some of his suggestions for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ozbikNQ.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I‚Äôm Jaime Lopez Jr and I‚Äôm a software developer by day and a podcaster by night.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking because I wanted to reach a new audience where I could share my knowledge, experiences, and stories. I‚Äôve co-hosted a podcast (<a href=\"https://mtjc.fireside.fm/\">More Than Just Code</a>) for the past 4-5 years, so public speaking was a natural extension of that experience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like being able to share things that I have learned because I hope that my experiences can be helpful to others who encounter the same struggles that I have encountered.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has benefited my career by providing an opportunity to meet other people in the industry that I wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily get a chance to meet!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first conference talk. I co-presented a talk at 360iDev in Denver, Colorado with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timmitra\">Tim Mitra</a> (my friend and a co-host of More Than Just Code).</p>\n<p>The talk went very well from what I recall. The topic was about the way that hosting a technical podcast can help developers in their careers, which plays to our strengths as experienced podcasters. Of course it also helped that we had a few die-hard fans in the audience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Looking at my Google Sheets spreadsheet where I track this, I‚Äôve applied to about <strong>115 conferences in the past three years or so</strong>. I‚Äôve been accepted by 14 conferences and have spoken at (or am scheduled to speak at) 9 of those conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I like to find a quiet place to collect my thoughts about an hour prior to when I give my presentation. It certainly helps when there is a dedicated room for speakers to do this! Also, if possible I try to check out the room where I‚Äôll be speaking so I can get a sense of the acoustics as well as how the audience will experience the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>I generally try not to memorize my talks because it causes me to become robotic when speaking</strong>. Instead, I walk through the main points (generally a single word) that I want to mention related to my slides or code that I‚Äôm sharing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is one main piece of advice that I can give new speakers:</p>\n<p><strong>It is usually difficult to get started as a conference speaker in terms of getting your CFP submissions accepted. This is totally okay and you don‚Äôt need to worry about it!</strong></p>\n<p>I subscribed to the (now-defunct) <a href=\"https://techspeak.email/\">Technically Speaking newsletter</a> that was put together by Chiu-Ki Chan and Cate Huston. The content in that newsletter (which is still available online) helped me craft my CFP submissions so that there is a better chance of being accepted. As well, the Technically Speaking newsletter helped me feel better about CFP acceptance rates (which if I recall they said was somewhere about 10%).</p>\n<p>If I‚Äôve learned anything over the past few years of submitting to CFPs, <strong>it‚Äôs that it is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference</strong> (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP).</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers that come to mind.</p>\n<p>First is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/savinola\">Laura Savino</a>. The way she gives technical presentations makes the audience feel as if they‚Äôre going along on a shared journey. Each step of the way seems like a friend is sharing their favorite locations in an unfamiliar city.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkb9z68nhyo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Readable Code - Laura Savino - DDD Europe 2018</em></p>\n<p>Second is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nickolas Means</a>. I‚Äôve been impressed with the way that he can smoothly deliver stories that involve a lot of technical detail.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BkjG0j1.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I don‚Äôt remember exactly how or why I first got into public speaking. I believe my first tech talks were at small user groups in the Grand Rapids, Michigan tech community around 2010 or so. From there I got into guesting on podcasts, then hosting my own podcast, and then speaking at conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I have an altruistic reason and a selfish reason for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<p>The altruistic reason is that I can help a lot of people by speaking at conferences and sharing my message with attendees.</p>\n<p>The selfish reason is that speaking at conferences is a good way to boost my career prospects as a technology consultant. Since I‚Äôve only started speaking at conferences about six months ago, I think it‚Äôs too early to expect to see any tangible benefit from it yet. One way conference speaking has intangibly benefited me though is that I can now list in my bio that I‚Äôve spoken at certain conferences like RubyConf India which I think carries a lot of weight among my peers, and I can truthfully say that I‚Äôm an ‚Äúinternational speaker‚Äù.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at a regional conference called DevOpsDays Midwest in St. Louis, Missouri in September 2018. Since I had already been speaking at local user groups for years before that point, this speaking gig didn‚Äôt feel like too big of a jump up. I‚Äôm happy to say that as far as I can tell, the talk went fine.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to many dozens of conferences. I‚Äôve spoken at five conferences at the time of this interview with two more conference talks coming up, for a total of seven. I‚Äôve been accepted to more conferences than that but sometimes I can‚Äôt go because there‚Äôs a schedule conflict or the travel expense is too much to justify at the time.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have a pre-talk routine. I rehearse beforehand but on the day of the talk I just get up and do it.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I only have one piece of advice: If getting a talk proposal accepted seems like an unattainable goal, just keep sending in proposals and you‚Äôll probably eventually get something accepted.</p>\n<p>I had to submit dozens of proposals before I finally got a talk accepted, at least a talk at a conference I was able to attend. At this point I‚Äôve actually gotten more talks accepted than I can take on and I‚Äôve had to throttle back on sending in proposals. The act of giving my first talk gave me a couple ideas for my next talk. My next talk gave me several more ideas for future talks, and so on. The more I submitted proposals and the more I spoke, the easier it all got.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I think part of my motivation for speaking at conferences was seeing the success that my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlainChautard\">Alain Chautard</a> has had with it and seeing the impact speaking has had on his consulting career.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJwvmuK4tQw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alain Chautard at NG Conf 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

So I started reading up on exactly how conferences decided on talks and started submitting to CFPs!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy all the people I‚Äôve been able to meet as a result of the speaking that I‚Äôve done. <strong>I especially enjoy chatting with people at the speaker dinners or other informal events surrounding the conference.</strong> As far as benefits to my career, some of these connections I‚Äôve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs, new clients and even (arguably) this interview.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at WordCamp Nashville in 2016. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/03/17/keanan-koppenhaver-take-wp-admin-to-the-next-level-with-advanced-custom-fields/\">video is actually online</a>, though I cringe watching it. It was a 20 minute ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù and I remember having to follow an awesome speaker who had the audience on the edge of their seat the entire time. The majority of my talk actually went well, but near the end (~14:00) you can see my heart jump up into my throat when one of my demos didn‚Äôt work correctly! Luckily, I was able to fix it and finish the talk, and <strong>this definitely wasn‚Äôt the last time demos didn‚Äôt work exactly right</strong>.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Between conferences and meetups, I‚Äôve probably spoken at between 20-30 and applied to probably twice that many. I don‚Äôt really apply to conferences that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd be a great fit for, but even then sometimes they just really can‚Äôt take everybody.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><em>Cue Eye of the Tiger montage‚Ä¶</em></p>\n<p>But seriously, I usually just try to get into the room I‚Äôll be speaking in before I have to give my talk (either by getting to the conference early in the morning or during lunch) and make sure my computer can interface with the projector and that the fonts on my slides are readable even in the back of the room.</p>\n<p><strong>I always try to attend the talk before mine in the same room</strong>, just so I can start setting up and doing a final check of everything as soon as the last presenter is done with their talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think there‚Äôs definitely lots of feelings from new speakers around not being knowledgeable enough to start speaking. <strong>But if a conference was only filled with super-advanced talks, they would lose a huge part of their audience.</strong> So, even if you just learned something, you can teach it and many attendees will welcome your perspective as a relatively-recent beginner. <strong>Since you just went through it all for the first time yourself, you know and remember all the roadblocks that someone getting started will have and can help them learn even quicker.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to that, the one thing that started really getting me more speaking opportunities is <strong>submitting multiple talks to each CFP</strong>. Conference organizers sometimes have an agenda of the talks they‚Äôre looking to accept and if you submit more talks, you give them more chances to fit you into the schedule they‚Äôre looking to craft. (However, some conferences specifically say to not submit more than X talks, so definitely abide by that.)</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garybernhardt\">Gary Bernhardt</a>, specifically <a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript\">Wat and The Birth and Death of Javascript</a> just because he manages to inject lots of humor into his talks while still keeping them super informative. I also loved <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en\">Tim Urban on Procrastination</a> just because of both his graphics and the way he walks the audience through his talk.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>More info about me is at <a href=\"https://keanan.dev\">keanan.dev</a> but most of the writing I do is on our company site at <a href=\"https://alphaparticle.com\">alphaparticle.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm speaking at a few meetups here in Chicago in the coming months, so I hope to see some familiar faces there!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Keanan Koppenhaver, Software Developer and Entrepreneur","path":"/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/05/05","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Hpvw9lfOx1bzUDmXv3UnLd5ur8IlT34z"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FDVubKV.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>About 8 years ago, I was a JavaScript Test Developer working for an outsourcer in Romania (I happen to be Romanian), contracting for Mozilla. A friend was organizing this conference called Open Source Open Mind and wanted someone from our team to come to speak about Mozilla and how to get involved. I was terrified of public speaking, but luckily one of my coworkers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ioana_cis\">Ioana</a>, said she‚Äôd do it. Ioana was in the US at a client on-site just before the conference though, so she asked me to do the slides for her. Naively, I accepted, thinking there‚Äôs no harm in it and it‚Äôs the least I could do since she was getting me out of having to be on stage.</p>\n<p>The day of the conference rolls around, and we‚Äôre all in the airport early in the morning, waiting for Ioana‚Äôs flight to land. Just as the airport was listing her flight as ‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù, we got a message from Ioana to go ahead to the conference, and stall as much as possible, she‚Äôll be on the next flight and should be there in time for the last slot of the day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pensacolla\">Marcela</a>, the conference organizer, being a friend, kept pushing Ioana‚Äôs talk further in the schedule. But the last talk of the day comes up, and Ioana is nowhere to be found. So Marcela goes up on stage and looks panicked at the audience, sees me in the front row, and just blurts out: ‚ÄúAnd now, talking about the Mozilla community‚Ä¶Alex is going to talk about the Mozilla community!‚Äú.</p>\n<p>I was dumbstruck, I got on stage and I just sat there quietly for about a minute. And then I started talking and didn‚Äôt stop until the Q&#x26;A part. It was horrible, I had my hands in my pocket the entire time, I made a bunch of rookie mistakes. There is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMnwjpy_3J0\">video of it</a> somewhere on youtube, luckily in Romanian, so not very popular. To this day I still use it as an example of ‚Äòwhat not to do‚Äô during my public speaking training. üòÖ</p>\n<p>When the Q&#x26;A part came, people were a bit on edge, and every time someone bashed Firefox with their questions, I took a step into the audience. I think I finished the Q&#x26;A part literally in the middle of the audience, and trying to make a step to my left to go towards the last person that asked a question. That‚Äôs when I realized maybe it was time to end the talk, well over my allotted time slot.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs how I started speaking in public. A few weeks after that I was MCing one of the community events we had going, someone from the Mozilla Community team saw me and decided that‚Äôs what I was going to do moving forward. I got tons of mentorship from the Mozilla people, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a>, as I was starting out and it just encouraged me to get better and be on stage more often than in the audience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The reason I speak at conferences is simple. I feel guilty about being privileged enough to have gone to a Computer Science University, so <strong>I try as much as possible to help other people get into tech, or get better at tech</strong>. Knowing I helped at least one person by being on stage and sharing my knowledge makes me feel a bit better about that.</p>\n<p>I used to think public speaking was making me a better communicator, so it was helping me indirectly in my career as a JavaScript Developer. But about two years ago I got a job as a JavaScript Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://developer.nexmo.com/team\">Nexmo</a>, and my community work and public speaking was the reason I got the job. So it helped me directly in my career, to the point its part of my day to day work! üòÖ</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mWBqS30hoI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alex Lakatos at View Source</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt really have an exact number, but let‚Äôs go with ‚Äúa lot‚Äù. For context, last year I‚Äôve either spoken, attended, hosted or sponsored 40 events (not just conferences, but smaller meetups as well). If I had to venture a guess based on my slides repo on Github, I‚Äôd say <strong>I spoke at around 50 conferences and meetups so far</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, and it‚Äôs a little embarrassing, to be honest. <strong>I get so nervous before going on stage that I can‚Äôt eat, drink or interact with people.</strong> There is this Psychology of Winning that tells you how to get into a winner mindset, and that calms down my nerves enough to get on stage and start talking. After the first minute or so practice takes over and I actually enjoy being on stage but let me tell you about getting there.</p>\n<p><strong>I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won</strong> (dunno what, but the point is I‚Äôm a winner now!): pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few ‚ÄúHell yeah!‚Äús if I think the toilet it empty (spoiler alert: it rarely is as empty as I think). That makes me think I just won something, I don‚Äôt need to win on stage as well, and it calms my nerves enough so I don‚Äôt shake as I speak.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There are so many things I can list, it‚Äôll just end up being another blog post just for this question. I think there are a lot more resources out there now compared to when I started, so <strong>my advice is just ‚Äúpractice‚Äù. No one did great the first time they got on stage or the second one, but practice makes perfect.</strong> So look at your presentations, identify the areas you could have done better (be it slides, content, posture, delivery), and then find the next conference or meetup where you can practice your talk some more and improve on those points.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for resources on public speaking or want to take the plunge and become a Developer Advocate, I co-curated this newsletter called ‚ÄúDeveloper Avocados ü•ë Weekly‚Äù. If you <a href=\"http://developeravocados.net/\">subscribe</a>, you get a bunch of highly curated articles from the past week in your inbox every Monday, along with a few conferences CFPs that support speakers with travel and accommodation.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>When I started out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertnyman\">Robert Nyman</a> helped me and inspired me a lot.</p>\n<p>Today, I think one of my favorite speakers is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simona_cotin/\">Simona Cotin</a>. I like her Serverless talks a lot, the live coding with a fallback to recordings is something I keep telling people they should do more of in their talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTrHSQbxR-Y' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Simona Cotin at JAMStack</em>conf 2018_</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>I hang out on Twitter these days, so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lakatos88\">follow me there</a>. I‚Äôm hoping my next talk is going to be JSUnconf, but it is an unconference so it‚Äôs a bit uncertain.

One thing I really admire about Joe is his eagerness to help new developers find their way in our industry. While we didn‚Äôt talk about it in this interview, he runs <a href=\"http://chicagoapprenticeships.com/\">Chicago Apprenticeships</a>, a site dedicated to helping bootcamp graduates find their first development job.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>I‚Äôve always looked at Joe as someone who really knows his stuff, so it was interesting to me to hear that Joe still struggles with nerves when he‚Äôs speaking. Remember, people may look like they‚Äôve got it all together on the outside, and still be nervous!</p>\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pUB2xtQ.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Joe! I‚Äôve been in tech for a very long time, and giving talks at conferences for maybe five years. I‚Äôm very much a generalist, so I take a lot of different roles in tech. Overall, though, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve been most interested in making teams more effective lately.</p>\n<p><strong>I was originally on the fence about whether I should give a talk. Too nervous.</strong> While grabbing drinks with someone much more experienced than myself, she basically told me to get over it and just apply. That turned out to be great advice. Since then I‚Äôve given a ton of talks, both soft topics and purely technical ones.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôve been incredibly fortunate to get to meet and become friends with some of my heroes in the industry as a result of speaking at conferences.</strong> That‚Äôs probably the biggest benefit for me. The Ruby community ‚Äî where I give most of my talks ‚Äî is full of supportive, brilliant folks, so that‚Äôs really made me feel good about participating.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs definitely impacted my career. <strong>I still get folks coming to talk to me about talks I gave a few years ago.</strong> I can point to videos of my talks when talking to companies or folks inside my own company. And it let me sharpen my own thinking and discussion skills around tech topics. It‚Äôs been a huge boon.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFuzIWz6Ynk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Joe speaking at Rails Conf, 2017</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Honestly I don‚Äôt think I slept for three days before my first talk. One of the reasons I enjoy giving talks is that I get to work on my fear of speaking in front of crowds. That said, <strong>I always struggle right before I actually get on stage.</strong> I was at a single track conference in a theatre auditorium, which made me feel even more nervous.</p>\n<p>But once I was on stage, I was able to get into a rhythm and really get across the ideas I wanted to convey. And at some point I remembered that I do know and care about my topic deeply. That gave me a lot of confidence. I‚Äôd say it was a success.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to a few dozen. I‚Äôve been accepted at maybe a quarter of those that I applied to? <strong>I have a much easier time getting accepted at regional and US-based conferences.</strong> I‚Äôd really like to do more international speaking, but I think I probably need to have more visibility domestically and focus more on that goal before it‚Äôll happen. I‚Äôm also much more comfortable in communities that I feel attached to (Ruby) than general programming conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Panic? Honestly, I usually spend the morning of a talk walking back and forth clicking through my slides and making sure that I have the major points from that slide down cold. I‚Äôve never been good at preparing to the point where I‚Äôve got my entire talk scripted, so that‚Äôs helpful for me as a routine.</p>\n<p>I probably should script my entire talks, but that‚Äôs not really my speed.</p>\n<p><strong>I do wear the same t-shirt nearly every time I give a talk. That‚Äôs pretty much a ritual at this point.</strong></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Ignore the fear and just apply.</strong></p>\n<p>I can totally understand the impostor syndrome, it‚Äôs hard to make the transition from an audience member to a speaker. It‚Äôs a bit cliche, but I do try to help new speakers remember that <strong>the things that they learned in the past year are totally new material to others</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôd definitely recommend taking advantage of any speaker help that conferences offer.</strong> It‚Äôs a huge boon to get people to listen to your talk ahead of time. There are also lots of articles out there on how to write a good proposal. Overall, let other peoples‚Äô hard won wisdom get you through the early parts.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve had the fortune or misfortune to speak on the same stage as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandimetz\">Sandi Metz</a> before. The clarity of how she conveys deep technical ideas always blows my mind. She‚Äôs definitely the person whose style I‚Äôd like to get better at emulating. If I would just start scripting my talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzWLGMtXflg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Sandi Metz at RubyConf 2017</em></p>\n<p>That said, there are plenty of other speakers with really different styles who all convey ideas really effectively, in really different ways. Say, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nick Means</a> versus <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searls\">Justin Searls</a>. You can‚Äôt take someone else‚Äôs voice, and you don‚Äôt need to.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>No conferences on the books now as I‚Äôm adjusting to a new job and hoping to take advantage of being in a company to get more opportunity to give talks.

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>After being reluctant (and admittedly nervous) to get on stage as a speaker, Nicola was finally\nconvinced that her experience was worth sharing. Her story is inspiring, because as Nicola points\nout, there aren‚Äôt a ton of speakers like her (Australian, female designers) out there.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm an independent product design consultant, working with software teams on their research and design as well as their process. I‚Äôm Australian, but I travel around a lot now days.</p>\n<p>I really had to force myself into public speaking. <strong>I was that girl who was so nervous I felt sick when I had to answer a question in class in front of people in high school.</strong> I was so shy and scared of public speaking. I never, ever thought I‚Äôd be speaking at conferences one day.</p>\n<p>I was lucky later on that I had a manager (Lawrence Crowther) who kept suggesting I give a talk. I think the fact that he saw me as someone who should be on stage was what I needed to feel like I could do it. Then the guy who runs Web Directions in Sydney reached out to me on Twitter after some blog posts I wrote, and specifically said he‚Äôd love to see my application to speak at the conference coming up. They promised speaker training for anyone who wanted it, so I went ahead and applied. Lo and behold, I was accepted‚Ä¶ So then I had to force myself to get comfortable with public speaking in a matter of a few months.</p>\n<p>I really appreciate both of these people for believing I was the right person to be on stage, and encouraging me to do it. <strong>I think to get less represented people on stage, we really need to just ask them more.</strong> It‚Äôs hard to imagine yourself on stage if you‚Äôve never really seen someone like you doing it. I didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd seen many young, Aussie, female designers doing talks, so I guess it just didn‚Äôt really seem like something I could do.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qTCPnIX.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The two things I‚Äôve spoken about most - retrospectives and collaborative user research - are both things I‚Äôm really passionate about. So it‚Äôs just exciting to be able to share information I really think people should have.</p>\n<p>On a more selfish level, <strong>its great to be able to speak about the thing you‚Äôre interested in in front of a lot of people, because it means for the rest of the conference the other people who share your passion will come up and talk to you.</strong> I‚Äôve met some really interesting people. And having spoken about your field at conferences gives you a little boost of initial authority on the subject that you otherwise have to build from scratch every time you meet a new client.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I tested out that my laptop connection and slides were working so many times in the break before my talk that they had to shoo me off stage. And still, the connection totally failed when I got up there in front of 800 people. The AV guy had to actually restart my computer on stage while I was standing there introducing myself at length. Super awkward! But I feel like I swallowed the frog: the possibly worst thing happened the first time. It all had to be uphill from there.</p>\n<p>(For the record, the talk went fine once we got the slides working again!)</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve spoken at 3 conferences, with #4 coming up in June. Two in Sydney one in Kingston, Jamaica (!) and the next in Cornwall in the UK. I‚Äôve applied to a lot more than that!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5mC7jQ3Lto' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Nicola Rushton at WebCraftConf - User Research is for Everyone</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I always try and test out the talk on a real audience or two before the conference.</strong> Whether that‚Äôs at a workplace or a Meetup, I always find things to change and get feedback from people. I will practice my talk probably ten or more times in the few weeks before the conference, just in my house talking to the walls!</p>\n<p>Directly on the day of the talk, I don‚Äôt have much of a routine. If anyone asks me about how I‚Äôm feeling I tell them ‚Äúexcited!‚Äù Even if I‚Äôm actually totally nervous, I find that embodying excitement helps me feel that way. I normally don‚Äôt eat much on the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The most useful thing I have ever been told regarding public speaking was that <strong>the intense rush of adrenaline and nerves before you get on stage is COMPLETELY NORMAL and it happens to everyone, even people who‚Äôve been doing it for years</strong>. In fact, if it stops happening, there‚Äôs something wrong. When I felt like that before, I used to get kind of worried and feel like maybe it would cause me to shake or faint on stage or something. But now I just observe that feeling and think to myself, awesome. My body is giving me all the adrenaline and hormones to do an awesome job of this. And I know it doesn‚Äôt come across on stage (especially if you smile!)</p>\n<p><strong>Think about starting by talking at Meetups, being on panels, or even hosting a Meetup.</strong> Smaller moments of being on stage helped me feel comfortable building up to standing up and speaking for 45 minutes straight.</p>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs also worth saying that representation on stage can be really useful for other people in the audience. Seeing people like you doing things can make someone reconsider whether they might be the right person to do that thing too. <strong>Just by being up there and being yourself you could be encouraging someone else to get up and share the thing they‚Äôre passionate about too.</strong> I find this perspective valuable if I start to feel imposter syndrome.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>One of the most useful things I did for myself when forcing myself to become comfortable with public speaking was to <strong>hold myself to a low standard</strong>.</p>\n<p>That might sound really counterintuitive, but I just told myself at the start that if I got on stage, said everything I wanted to say, and didn‚Äôt trip over myself, then it would be a huge success. Then the next time, I pushed myself to do all of that and one more thing. Then the next time, just a tiny bit better. This allowed me to always feel REALLY positive and successful and happy about my public speaking. I didn‚Äôt want to get into feeling like I didn‚Äôt do good enough, and become discouraged. So really, my goal is to just be myself on stage, have good content, and communicate what I want to communicate in an engaging way.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt compare myself to anyone else!</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://nicolarushton.com/\">www.nicolarushton.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicolarushton\">Nicola on Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/nicola-rushton/\">Nicola on Linkedin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My next conference talk is in <a href=\"https://agileonthebeach.com/sessions/2019/bring-the-team-along-for-the-ride-why-products-are-better-when-agile-teams-do-research-together/\">June at Agile on the Beach, UK</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Nicola Rushton, Overcoming Reluctance to Share Her Passion","path":"/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/04/12","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1npb2OhWZlDsfQEdUPaQu8uTrigII2--w"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I was raised in Paris, France then moved to Los Angeles in the 90s where I studied some computer science and quickly got into web applications development.</p>\n<p>My early career was focused on front-end development before we had standards such as CSS and the DOM - before AJAX was a thing. Fun trivia, back when Gmail first came out and people were impressed with its ‚Äúautocompletion‚Äù on email addressees, I won a contest to deliver <a href=\"http://wick.sourceforge.net/\">the first open-source framework to do this</a>. Nobody cared, but it was fun.</p>\n<p>Pretty quickly however, I got more into server-side software engineering with Java/J2EE, then PHP and C#/.Net, where I developed a better understanding of Object-Oriented Design, Database Design and Information Security.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been managing engineering organizations of various sizes since 2007, and to this day, remain close to the code, seeking out every opportunity to coach software engineers toward successful careers.</p>\n<p>Having learned many lessons ‚Äúthe hard way‚Äù over the past 20 years, in 2017 I started developing a growing portfolio of talks shining light on various aspects of Software Crafting and InfoSec. Having spoken at various local meetups, I got into my first ‚Äúfull software conference‚Äù as a speaker at the 2017 inaugural Coder <a href=\"https://www.codercruise.com\">Cruise Conference</a> by the fine folks at One for All Events. In 2017 I also spoke at a couple of InfoSec conferences by invitation from contacts developed from speaking at local OWASP meetups. All in all, 2017 ignited my speaking career.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eEzegV6.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has been a powerful cathartic outlet for overcoming my ever-growing frustration of seeing software engineers making the same mistakes I did earlier-on in my career.</p>\n<p>Far beyond this however, speaking with attendees and listening to their stories, experiences, frustrations and successes, has also been very rewarding and has often given me ideas for new talks, while helping me refine existing talks. Sharing meals and drinks with attendees is a lot of fun. I do tend to be shy though, so I find it easier to engage with people in more intimate settings. <strong>I make a point of sitting at tables of people I don‚Äôt know and listening to their conversations while slowly coming out of my shell.</strong></p>\n<p>I also love meeting and learning from other sharp speakers at conferences. It‚Äôs helped me correct misconceptions, learn new things, and think about various problems differently.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting to travel the World has been an unbelievable experience. The people, the sights, the food. Just amazing.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, I absolutely love meeting authors and contributors to open-source projects, with plenty of time to chat with them at speaker dinners and thank them profusely, in person, for their work. I‚Äôm also starting to contribute to some projects on Patreon.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first Software Engineering talk lacked structure. I jumped into concepts without sufficiently linking them with a common thread, both with slides and verbally. The audience was very supportive though and in general agreed with my concepts. Questions were thoughtful, and I did get a good amount of spontaneous positive feedback after it, with solid break-out discussions.</p>\n<p>My first InfoSec talk could date as far back as 2015 at a local OWASP Meetup. The graphics in my slides were just too ‚Äúthin‚Äù with insufficient contrast and text that was too small. My delivery wasn‚Äôt on-point either. <strong>Despite all that, several people came-up afterward to continue the discussion.</strong></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>In 2018, I started getting accepted to a good number of conferences and spoke at seven of them. In 2019 so-far I‚Äôm looking at seven conferences between March and June. I‚Äôd be happy to score a couple more for the fall/winter season, but I do have limited availability because speaking at conferences isn‚Äôt part of my job description.</p>\n<p>For each conference at which I speak, I take personal time off from work. I also save-up money to bring my Wife to <em>a couple</em> of conferences per year. We strategize about the destinations she‚Äôd hope for the most, and when her parents are available to take care of our 2 daughters for a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>I do apply to ‚Äúseveral dozen‚Äù conferences each year. It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ overwhelming at times.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go over my slides, rehearse mental timing milestones at various sections of it. In some cases make some last-minute tweaks if I find an opportunity to more closely align an area of the presentation with the conference‚Äôs audience. Or something relevant that just happened in the news.</li>\n<li>Try to scope out the room and check for connectivity, HDMI, Power.</li>\n<li>Make sure my laser pointer works.</li>\n<li>Figure out where I can stash a bottle of water near the podium for mid-talk swig.</li>\n<li>Scope out well ahead of my talk, where the Audio/Video engineers are in case I need their help.</li>\n<li>See whether the previous speaker in my room had any issue with the equipment.</li>\n<li>Get laptop, remote and everything set-up at least 10 minutes before my talk, I like to start setting-up 15-20 minutes ahead of time when I can, and be fully-ready at the 10-minute mark. Yea ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm also the person who shows-up at the airport at least 2 hours before any flight even with CLEAR and Pre-check.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Conferences are literally yearning for new voices. Attendees are growing tired of seeing the same people at conferences year after year.</strong> An increasing number of conferences are focusing their attention on attracting new speakers with no speaking experience with a great emphasis on diversity for underrepresented demographics.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://selfconference.org\">SelfConference.org</a> ‚Äî Speaking at a conference doesn‚Äôt have to be about having mastered technology X or methodology Y. It can be about your journey, your struggles, your learning process. Conference attendees love seeing a person to whom they can relate, sharing their struggles and hearing their story.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some of the most compelling talks and keynotes I‚Äôve watched had nothing to do with technology. They were about human topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you‚Äôre struggling with mental health, become a spokesperson for <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">OSMIHelp.org</a>, and educate us.</li>\n<li>If you‚Äôre struggling with discrimination, educate us.</li>\n<li>If you‚Äôre struggling with accessibility, educate us.</li>\n<li>If you care about something, educate us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Turn the World into allies for the causes you care about.</strong></p>\n<p>Back to technology though, if you fear ‚Äúimposter syndrome‚Äù, just know that you have valuable experience to share. I use this syndrome as motivation to more thoroughly research topics I speak on, and to seek out prevailing counter arguments to the points I‚Äôm about to make.</p>\n<p>With all this said, the most defensible position lies within what has worked for you, from the confines of realities which you had to face.</p>\n<p>Finally, keep in mind that conference organizers and their speaker selection panels know what they‚Äôre doing. <strong>If they‚Äôve picked you, it‚Äôs important for you to realize that they‚Äôve done their due-diligence, and that you absolutely, positively, unequivocally belong on that stage.</strong></p>\n<p>So what‚Äôs the downside to submitting? What‚Äôs the worst that can happen? You might unleash your awesomeness unto the World?</p>\n<p>Bring it.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sandimetz.com\">Sandi Metz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/anjanavakil\">Anjana Vakil</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ieatkillerbees\">Samantha Qui√±ones</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CalEvans\">Cal Evans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonskeet\">Jon Skeet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jenna.io\">Jenna Quindica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/xiehan\">Nara Kasbergen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docondev.com\">Doc Norton</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eryno\">Eryn O‚ÄôNeil</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/philsturgeon\">Phil Sturgeon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HMSEvans\">Stephanie Evans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewtrask\">Matthew Trask</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaMauerhan\">Jessica Mauerhan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/saramg\">Sara Golemon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com\">Scott Wlaschin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanColdwater\">Ian Coldwater</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jbrains.ca\">J.B.

In this interview, we cover how she got into speaking at tech\nconferences, her advice for new speakers, and some of the ways speaking has\nbenefited her professionally.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0KSCAln6MEJrW0a3URY6ow.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve become a more active speaker at technical conferences just in the last\nyear. Over the past several years, I would speak here and there, generally after\nbeing invited by someone involved with the event. But last year I was looking\ninto conferences I might want to attend for women in tech, and I saw a CFP on\nthe website for one of them. I thought, ‚ÄúOh, maybe instead of just attending\nthese conferences, I could speak at them,‚Äù and I was right!</p>\n<p>I wish I had realized sooner that <strong>you don‚Äôt always have to be personally\ninvited to speak at events.</strong> Now that I‚Äôm aware of the CFP process, I‚Äôm\nspeaking regularly at conferences across the country.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences? Has it benefited your career?</h3>\n<p>I think conferences can be such a fun way to meet people, whether you‚Äôre\nspeaking or not. But I have to admit, being a speaker has its perks. There are\ndinners, networking events, sometimes lounges specifically for the speakers,\nwhich build an immediate sense of community. I‚Äôve been blown away by some of the\nother speakers I‚Äôve met in these settings.</p>\n<p>Speaking also establishes your authority in your subject area, and it gives you\nthe chance to genuinely help people learn something new. This teaching aspect is\nespecially important to me, given my background in the education space.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Being in EdTech, I‚Äôve always spoken at events for teachers, which was a natural\nprogression from being in the classroom and participating in or leading\nprofessional development sessions. But my first speaking engagement that was for\nmore of a technical and business-oriented audience was on a panel of EdTech\nentrepreneurs at <a href=\"https://1871.com/\">Chicago‚Äôs tech incubator and hub, 1871</a>.\nOne of the organizers had seen me giving a product demo and asked for me to join\nthe event, perhaps to help them avoid the dreaded all-male panel (or ‚Äúmanel‚Äù).</p>\n<p>And again, this experience corrected some misconceptions I had about public\nspeaking. I used to think all panelists must be exceptional at coming up with\noff-the-cuff responses to tricky questions on the spot, and maybe some of them\nare, but that‚Äôs definitely not the norm.</p>\n<p>In my experience at the 1871‚Äôs event, the panelists were all given the questions\nahead of time so we could prepare, and I was asked if I‚Äôd be comfortable kicking\nthe panel off by responding to the first question. I didn‚Äôt need to worry about\ncoming up with responses in the moment, because I was prepped ahead of time,\nwhich made the experience a lot less intimidating. And the format of a panel ‚Äî\nbeing seated, one in a row of several speakers ‚Äî creates a more casual vibe as\nwell. <strong>I‚Äôd definitely recommend panels as a gateway experience for anyone who\nis considering branching out into public speaking.</strong></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve spoken at about 10 conferences to date, and I currently have 4 more\nscheduled in the coming months. I don‚Äôt keep count on how many I‚Äôve applied to,\nbut it‚Äôs been a lot! <strong>I definitely don‚Äôt get accepted to every event ‚Äî I don‚Äôt\nthink anyone does.</strong> But I‚Äôve very much enjoyed the conferences I‚Äôve been a part\nof, and I‚Äôm looking forward to the ones ahead.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I try to access the room some time before my session to make sure the AV setup\nis good to go, but apart from that, I‚Äôm usually attending someone else‚Äôs session\nright up until it‚Äôs time for mine to start!</p>\n<p>I know not everyone‚Äôs schedules allow them to spend the full day at the event,\nbut <strong>I think it‚Äôs a shame when speakers come in just for their session and then\nleave.</strong> I make it a point to support and learn from the other speakers when I‚Äôm\nat a conference, so my session is usually one of many that I participate in\nthroughout the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>My biggest piece of advice is to just go for it!</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm involved in a lot of online communities, and I‚Äôll see people posting in\nSlack, asking if they should respond to a CFP they‚Äôre interested in. My response\nis always yes. Why not? <strong>It doesn‚Äôt take much to respond to a CFP. You don‚Äôt\nhave to have a whole session ready to go. You just need an idea and an\nabstract.</strong></p>\n<p>Think of something you‚Äôve been successful at professionally, and then think of\nwhat advice you‚Äôd give to others on that topic. Can you come up with 5‚Äì10 tips\nto make your audience better at X? A coding language, a new tool, even a soft\nskill? Then you‚Äôve got enough to respond to a CFP.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of resources on writing strong CFP submissions, so I‚Äôd recommend\ndoing a little research in that area, but <strong>don‚Äôt be intimidated, especially if\nyou‚Äôre a member of an underrepresented group. Conferences need more\nrepresentation of diversity and inclusion.</strong> Go for it!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers who have inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One that comes to mind is Jennifer Wesley at Google, who gave the opening\nremarks at the Women Techmakers Summit in Chicago for International Women‚Äôs Day\nrecently. She stands out to me because she was able to get personal on stage,\nand in doing so, she established that the summit was a safe space for women.\n<strong>By being willing to be a little vulnerable with her personal story, she set\nthe tone for the whole day.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/95g2cd8pwe8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Jennifer Wesley at TEDxParker speaking about women in STEM</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I always post about my upcoming sessions on\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LBJanusek\">Twitter</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbjanusek/\">LinkedIn</a>, and I share speaker\ndiscounts there when I can, so follow or connect with me if you‚Äôre interested.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Laura Janusek, Chief Product Officer in Educational Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/03/31","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0KSCAln6MEJrW0a3URY6ow.jpeg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

One of the things I love about speaking at conferences is the\nopportunity to meet people from all over the world, so reading Geshan‚Äôs\nexperience as a speaker on multiple continents was inspiring.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*mQ216JZETiJBtVpHdGLBkA.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>Tell me about yourself? How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I have been a software engineer for more than a decade now. I have worked as a\nsoftware engineer in 3 countries in the past 10 years. I am primarily a backend\nsoftware engineer who dabbles in the frontend side of things once in a while.</p>\n<p>I used to do public speaking even in 2010 but I restarted doing it in 2014 when\nI spoke at a meetup in Kathmandu, Nepal. Then I started sending out abstract to\nCFPs in 2015, and in 2016 I spoke at my first conference: Code Motion Dubai.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like meeting like-minded people with the profession in common. All of us are\nsolution providers at the end of the day at times with code and sometimes\nwithout code too. I like the positive energy conferences have and regardless of\nwhere you work or the number of years of experience one has all of the\nparticipants are there to learn and share the experience. I admire the time,\neffort and resources put in by speakers for their talk.</p>\n<p>Public speaking, to be honest, has benefited my career both directly and\nindirectly. It has surely given me recognition and many people have approached\nme after doing some public speaking for various reasons. To be honest, adding a\nsection in your CV where you have spoken in a couple of good conferences does\nadd more value.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>My first big conference talk was in August, 2016 in Amsterdam for Laracon EU.\nProbably that was the biggest audience I had spoken in front of and included all\nthe who‚Äôs who of that community. It was a talk on ChatOps and I think for that\ncommunity of people it was a relatively new thing then.</p>\n<p><span class=\"figcaption_hack\">Geshan‚Äôs first big conference talk at Laracon EU, 2016</span></p>\n<p>I think it went pretty well, I was shaky and nervous when I started of course\nand then after the first 10 minutes I think I was in the flow and telling most\nof the things I had to talk about.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, I have lost count on how many CFPs I have submitted my abstracts,\nfrom 2015 it surely should be in the 100s. I generally submit to conferences\nthat cover both travel and accommodations or at least travel. Like an e-commerce\nwebsite, I believe (at least for me) the conversion (success) rate is like 1% or\nless :). In total from 2016 to now I have spoken at 4 conferences in 4\ncontinents, not sure if it qualifies me to be called an international speaker\nfrom Nepal though :).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I narrate the talk to myself the night before. Then right before the talk, I\nmake sure I have things I need with me like water, screen connections, and that\nthe screen size is fine. After I get on stage, I focus on delivering the message\nwith the right impact.</p>\n<p>I try to keep preparation pretty simple: don‚Äôt over-prepare, keep things\nspontaneous, but have some direction and keep an eye on the time.</p>\n<p>I usually don‚Äôt have speaker notes so I look at the slides and then improvise on\nthem. That‚Äôs why even if I do the same talk a second time, the details I include\neach time will be different.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For new speakers, there are two main pieces of advice:</p>\n<p><strong>First, give your talk on local meetups.</strong> Local user group meetups are always\nlooking for speakers so if you approach them you will rarely hear a no you can‚Äôt\npresent. Depending on your city, the frequency of meetups in your area of tech\nmight be many, little, or none. When you practice your talk in a smaller group\nyou get feedback and also get over imposter syndrome.</p>\n<p>Speaking is not a thing for everyone, so try it in a smaller group. If you like\nit do it more, but bare in mind public speaking is a very important skill for\nyour career.</p>\n<p><strong>The second one is to work on your title and abstract.</strong> When conferences have\nCFPs the main thing in my opinion that stands out is your title and abstract.\nThe relevance of the talk in that conference is vital too, for instance, a Ruby\nconference will never accept a PHP 7 features talk. As some conferences have\nblind speaker selection, always work an extra bit on your title and abstracts.</p>\n<p>Then, it‚Äôs all about submitting your talk to all the CFPs you can find. The best\nway to find CFPs is <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">confs.tech</a>,\nlanyrd.com (it‚Äôs usually down though),\n<a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">callingallpapers.com</a>.

While writing talks are a huge time\ncommitment, there is nothing quite like explaining a concept to others to help\ncrystalize it in your mind.</p>\n<p>And, speaking is an incredible way to connect with other people outside of your\ntech silo and/or geographic area. It has also opened up additional career\nopportunities for me, and has resulted in growing in different directions as\nwell, like writing blog posts and answering interview questions!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?

I think the talk was meant to be 20\nminutes or so and I was overly concerned about running short.</p>\n<p>It went pretty well, and people laughed at my jokes, but I was far more nervous\nthan I‚Äôd expected to be.

I really couldn‚Äôt pick so I‚Äôll try and talk about speakers with\ntotally different types of talks.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nicholas Means</a> who takes you through\nincredibly real stories about disasters and almost disasters and what we can\nlearn from them.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//099cHWSbAL8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://twitter.com/editingemily\">Emily Freeman</a> who talks about how the\nhuman reactions of all of us manifest themselves in our work and how that can\nhelp us be more cognizant of our actions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//dbKjzxd-f70' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I‚Äôve recently discovered some amazing speakers through youtube videos like\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/philip_roberts\">Philip Roberts</a> who did a great talk on the\njavascript event loop:</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//8aGhZQkoFbQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>Where can readers find out more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a website: <a href=\"http://laurieontech.com/\">laurieontech.com</a> (pardon the lack\nof responsive design, I just migrated to a new framework and it‚Äôs a work in\nprogress).
