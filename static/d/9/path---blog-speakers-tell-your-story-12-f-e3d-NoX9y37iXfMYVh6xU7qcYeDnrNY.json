If youâ€™re a conference speaker, <strong>Iâ€™d like to\npublish a short interview with you on this blog.</strong> It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™ve\nspoken one time or one hundred times, someone can benefit from hearing your\nstory.</p>\n<p>If youâ€™re interested, please email a short bio and link to your website to\n<a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I look forward to hearing your story!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Calling All Speakers: We Want to Hear Your Story","path":"/blog/speakers-tell-your-story/","category":"Updates","tags":null,"date":"2019/03/13","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*bmxvII4crxCtfxC8iV84Og.jpeg"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
