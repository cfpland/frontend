Like many speakers, George is an experienced software developer who‚Äôs passionate about mentoring and teaching newcomers to the field. In this week‚Äôs interview, hear more about how speaking at over 20 conferences so far has helped take George‚Äôs career to the next level.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://georgemandis.s3.amazonaws.com/holyjs-piter-2017/me-holy-js.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">George Mandis</a>. I‚Äôm currently a full stack, independent web developer at <a href=\"https://snaptortoise.com/\">SnapTortoise</a> based out of Portland, Oregon, though I wear quite a few other hats. I‚Äôve been freelancing for 13 years, but over the past 4 or 5 years I‚Äôve gravitated towards mentorship roles. Teaching classes, workshops, leading bootcamps and working with junior developers one-on-one has been a rewarding experience and speaking feels like a natural extension to this.</p>\n<p>My first foray into speaking was actually at an Ignite event in Portland where I summarized, in 5 minutes, my experience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2QC43jwPyM\">living as a digital nomad</a> for a year. I was terrified to speak in front of so many people, but it went well! After that I though I should look into conference speaking as a way to advance myself professionally, extend the aforementioned mentoring activities I mentioned and continue to travel and see the world, which is one my biggest passions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2QC43jwPyM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things ‚Äî not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!</strong></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs always interesting to me to see one type of work or technology in-demand in one place and find it barely mentioned at all in another. It‚Äôs also nice to humanize other developers and put a face and a personality to a name. These conferences also have a tendency to be expensive and difficult to otherwise attend, as an independent developer. Being able to attend these conferences and pick the brain of people who work at some very large, influential tech companies is a wonderful opportunity.</p>\n<p>I think the process of preparing a talk and speaking in front of a large group people could benefit anyone‚Äôs career, but for mine it‚Äôs certainly opened some doors. <strong>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.</strong></p>\n<p>The other benefit of speaking is I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a great opportunity to talk about the things you want to be doing, even if it‚Äôs not the thing you‚Äôre necessarily doing in your day-to-day. My talks tend to focus on creativity, art, hardware-dabbling and making interesting, outside-the-box projects through JavaScript. Speaking on these topics has allowed me to spend more time immersed in that world and meet other like-minded and very talented people with similar interests.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My very first ‚Äútalk‚Äù was the 5-minute Ignite talk I mentioned earlier, but my first <em>technical</em> talk was at HolyJS in Russia. I remember applying to a number of conferences by that point in the year. Some had accepted me but had no budget for travel, but HolyJS was the first one where everything lined up.</p>\n<p>The idea of talking for a full hour was incredibly daunting ‚Äî I‚Äôd never done that before! When I pulled up the conference website I became even more nervous ‚Äî David Crockford and Lea Verou were two developers I‚Äôd read and followed for most of my career, and they were head-lining the conference! My attitude going in was, <strong>if this goes terribly, at least I‚Äôm 2000 miles from home and probably won‚Äôt ever run into any of these people again.</strong> It sounds funny, but it really took the pressure off!</p>\n<p>Fortunately it went well, and I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôve seen several familiar faces from that conference at other conferences since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure I could put a number on the number I‚Äôve applied to. I‚Äôve spoken at something around 20 now, but can guarantee you <strong>my acceptance rate is in the single digits, percentage-wise.</strong> Like most opportunities, it really is a numbers game. You have to be diligent and persistent, but also mindful of how you might be able to tweak your proposals to better suit a particular conference‚Äôs theme.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>If I have time a day or two before the conference <strong>I like to walk to the venue from wherever I‚Äôm staying so that I‚Äôm not thinking too hard about finding it on the day I present.</strong> In the hours leading up to the presentation I practice saying key sentences and takeaways for specific slides as I go through the slide from beginning to end, over and over, and make sure all my demos work. Once it‚Äôs about 30-minutes or so to go I‚Äôll put the slides away and just try to clear my head. This routine changes depending on how new the talk is and how comfortable I‚Äôm feeling with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I also try to see as many other talks as I can</strong>, though I that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming. After I‚Äôve given my talk I‚Äôm much more relaxed and find it easier to enjoy the other talks. I try to make a point of shaking hands with all the speakers I see and letting them know I really appreciated what they spoke on. Other speakers might have differing opinions on that, but I know I genuinely appreciate it when someone in the audience comes up to me just to let me know they enjoyed my talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>When it comes to applying <strong>it really is a numbers game.</strong></p>\n<p>Apply early and often and try not to get too down on yourself if your talk isn‚Äôt accepted. For topics, there are many schools of thought on this, but I personally feel sharing a case study or story about how you used a particular piece of technology to achieve a specific goal is a good approach for giving your talk structure. Talking about why technology X is cool in general way can be just fine, but sharing how we used X at Y to achieve Z gives the audience something more concrete to walk away with.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre giving a workshop you can dive more deeply into the nitty-gritty workings of a thing and keep your focus there, but in a 20-40 minutes talk it‚Äôs more about introducing an idea and making the case for why others should have interest in it.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are quite a few, but I‚Äôll mention two people I met at my very first talk who I think are wonderful: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/g33konaut\">Martin Splitt</a>. The list could be much longer, but I‚Äôll stick with those for fear of omitting someone! I feel both of them have real passion for the web as an open platform and convey their enthusiasm and knowledge very well when they speak.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>Next, I‚Äôll be giving a talk called <a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2019\">‚ÄúHacking Hardware with JavaScript‚Äù at Teardown 2019 in Portland, Oregon</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about me, my projects, writing and where I‚Äôm speaking next on my website: <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">george.mand.is</a> and follow me on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgeMandis\">@georgeMandis</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: George Mandis, Digital Nomad and Web Developer","path":"/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/06/08","image":"https://georgemandis.s3.amazonaws.com/holyjs-piter-2017/me-holy-js.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GLa6cwP.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a software engineer from Kansas City, Missouri. I love to tech, and I love to share the cool things I‚Äôve learned with other people.</p>\n<p>I have always enjoyed going to schools to speak to students, but I was intrigued by conference speaking. One fateful evening I told <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a>, founder of Kansas City Women in Technology, that I was interested in speaking at tech conferences. She volunteered to be my mentor, set me up with resources for writing abstracts, and she sent me links to open CFPs for various conferences for me to begin submitting those abstracts. It felt like a whirlwind of events‚Ä¶I was writing abstracts the first week of December 2018, submitting those to conferences within the next week, and I got my first acceptance in January!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I‚Äôm providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.</p>\n<p>I do believe it has benefited my career, and it has helped me to shine a light on the things I believe are great.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference was DevFest KC this past February in Kansas City. <strong>I was super nervous, and I told the audience this was my first time speaking at a conference. I‚Äôm used to trying to engage small groups of teenagers, not 20-40 adults.</strong> However, I needn‚Äôt have worried so much. My audience was engaged, they asked questions, and they were eager to participate. By the end of the talk, they didn‚Äôt believe that was my first time.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312227563\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          \n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/312227563\">Rhia Dixon at the KC Women in Technology 2019 Kickoff</a></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>At the time of this response, I have applied to 28 conferences. Thus far, I have been accepted to speak at 6 of the 16 conferences that have announced their speakers (1 of which I‚Äôve already done).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine consists of taking one last look at my slides, a few deep breaths, and listening to whatever song that currently has my ears hostage (typically something upbeat and relatively positive with great musicality).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I would pass on some of the best advice I‚Äôve received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a topic that you wouldn‚Äôt mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.</li>\n<li>Write your abstract in such a way that the reader gets a pretty good understanding of why they should be at your talk and what they will get from attending.</li>\n<li>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you‚Äôve got friends in the audience ‚Äî some you may know, and some you may not know‚Ä¶yet.</li>\n<li>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts ‚Äî <strong>I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.</strong> I‚Äôve found this particularly helpful for tweaking my abstracts and tailoring my talks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I currently work at Comcast where I am the lead web developer for xFi. My first public presentation was at a Sass meetup in Philadelphia in 2012 where I volunteered to talk about a new open source project I was working on. From there I spoke at a few ‚Äúunconferences‚Äù &#x26; ‚Äúunconference tracks‚Äù at other conferences (where basically as long as you show up and there‚Äôs an open speaking slot, it‚Äôs yours) before I was first accepted to speak at a conference.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxfoundation/44425350705/in/faves-17844497@N00/\">The Linux Foundation, some rights reserved</a></em></p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The thing I enjoy the most is sharing my experiences, both on stage and in the conversations with attendees afterwards. It has also allowed me to travel to some fun and interesting places.</p>\n<p>There are a couple areas where it has directly benefited my career. <strong>I was given the opportunity to <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Sass-Converting-Existing-Site/434463-2.html\">create a course for Lynda.com</a> because I met Lynda.com staff author <a href=\"http://www.raybo.org/\">Ray Villalobos</a> after we both spoke at a conference.</strong> It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray. In addition, at my current role at Comcast I am expected to be having an impact outside of the company, and public speaking is the path I‚Äôve been leaning on to accomplish that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I was accepted to speak at via a CFP was the University of Illinois Web Conference in 2015. When I talked to folks that attended afterwards, everyone had good things to say, but given it was my first talk I essentially took that as I did not too anything terribly wrong, which was a great first step.</p>\n<p>My favorite talk I‚Äôve given so far is ‚ÄúThe Critical Career Path Conversation‚Äù which I premiered at The Lead Developer NYC in 2018. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLBzScQzZ83I8H8_0Qete6Bs5EcW3p0kZF&#x26;v=hMz6QDURQOM\">view it on YouTube</a>, including a fun glitch about one-third of the way through for you all to enjoy watching me struggle &#x26; recover from.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMz6QDURQOM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to about 70 so far and spoken at 20.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it üòú.</p>\n<p>I usually spend the hour before looking and my slide notes one last time and inevitably tweak a few things here or there. My system is to write out what I‚Äôm planning to say for each slide in the slide notes but then I rarely ever follow it directly once I start talking. It‚Äôs just a comfort feeling knowing that if I totally forget what I was going to say, the script is there.</p>\n<p>The last thing I do, which I do recommend, is to <strong>make sure you start off smiling</strong> üòÉ.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is so much I could say here but I‚Äôll limit it to a few quick hits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Imposter syndrome is real and a totally normal feeling</strong>, so do not let that hold you back. Especially early on, I always had a feeling of ‚Äúeveryone in the audience will already know what I‚Äôm talking about.‚Äù That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During the intro of your talk, let the audience know how you intend to take questions (raise your hand during the talk, hold them until the end, chat in the hallway later, email, etc.). If someone asks a question that you don‚Äôt know the answer to, it is much better to say ‚ÄúThat is a great question. I don‚Äôt know what the answer is so let me get back to you,‚Äù than to try to make up an answer on the spot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My CFP acceptance rate went up when I internalized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344\">this piece of advice from Fluent organizer Kyle Simpson</a>:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/advice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#advice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/designingATalk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#designingATalk</a><br><br>OK talks are about the topic.<br><br>Good talks are about the speaker/presentation.<br><br>Great talks are about the audience.</p>&mdash; getify (@getify) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are 2 in particular that I look up to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://meowni.ca/\">Monica Dinculescu</a> because when it comes to technical knowledge, she does an excellent job of taking a topic and distilling it down so that the audience can understand it and apply it immediately. She is able to do it while keeping her talk entertaining with healthy doses of humor and emojis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agiledeveloper.com/\">Venkat Subramaniam</a> is a marathon speaker that I am amazed by. He is a superhuman when it comes to learning new content and teaching it. At the last conference I spoke at, Venkat delivered a full day workshop on the first day and then gave a talk at literally every possible speaking slot over the course of the next 3 days, which totaled 13 separate 90 minute talks. The thing that amazes me even more (especially given my typical pre-talk routine) is he has no slides. He starts off each talk with some bullet point topics in a text editor and the magic happens from there.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

Read on to learn more about his process and some of his suggestions for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ozbikNQ.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I‚Äôm Jaime Lopez Jr and I‚Äôm a software developer by day and a podcaster by night.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking because I wanted to reach a new audience where I could share my knowledge, experiences, and stories. I‚Äôve co-hosted a podcast (<a href=\"https://mtjc.fireside.fm/\">More Than Just Code</a>) for the past 4-5 years, so public speaking was a natural extension of that experience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like being able to share things that I have learned because I hope that my experiences can be helpful to others who encounter the same struggles that I have encountered.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has benefited my career by providing an opportunity to meet other people in the industry that I wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily get a chance to meet!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first conference talk. I co-presented a talk at 360iDev in Denver, Colorado with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timmitra\">Tim Mitra</a> (my friend and a co-host of More Than Just Code).</p>\n<p>The talk went very well from what I recall. The topic was about the way that hosting a technical podcast can help developers in their careers, which plays to our strengths as experienced podcasters. Of course it also helped that we had a few die-hard fans in the audience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Looking at my Google Sheets spreadsheet where I track this, I‚Äôve applied to about <strong>115 conferences in the past three years or so</strong>. I‚Äôve been accepted by 14 conferences and have spoken at (or am scheduled to speak at) 9 of those conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I like to find a quiet place to collect my thoughts about an hour prior to when I give my presentation. It certainly helps when there is a dedicated room for speakers to do this! Also, if possible I try to check out the room where I‚Äôll be speaking so I can get a sense of the acoustics as well as how the audience will experience the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>I generally try not to memorize my talks because it causes me to become robotic when speaking</strong>. Instead, I walk through the main points (generally a single word) that I want to mention related to my slides or code that I‚Äôm sharing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is one main piece of advice that I can give new speakers:</p>\n<p><strong>It is usually difficult to get started as a conference speaker in terms of getting your CFP submissions accepted. This is totally okay and you don‚Äôt need to worry about it!</strong></p>\n<p>I subscribed to the (now-defunct) <a href=\"https://techspeak.email/\">Technically Speaking newsletter</a> that was put together by Chiu-Ki Chan and Cate Huston. The content in that newsletter (which is still available online) helped me craft my CFP submissions so that there is a better chance of being accepted. As well, the Technically Speaking newsletter helped me feel better about CFP acceptance rates (which if I recall they said was somewhere about 10%).</p>\n<p>If I‚Äôve learned anything over the past few years of submitting to CFPs, <strong>it‚Äôs that it is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference</strong> (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP).</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers that come to mind.</p>\n<p>First is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/savinola\">Laura Savino</a>. The way she gives technical presentations makes the audience feel as if they‚Äôre going along on a shared journey. Each step of the way seems like a friend is sharing their favorite locations in an unfamiliar city.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkb9z68nhyo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Readable Code - Laura Savino - DDD Europe 2018</em></p>\n<p>Second is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nickolas Means</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BkjG0j1.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I don‚Äôt remember exactly how or why I first got into public speaking. I believe my first tech talks were at small user groups in the Grand Rapids, Michigan tech community around 2010 or so. From there I got into guesting on podcasts, then hosting my own podcast, and then speaking at conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I have an altruistic reason and a selfish reason for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<p>The altruistic reason is that I can help a lot of people by speaking at conferences and sharing my message with attendees.</p>\n<p>The selfish reason is that speaking at conferences is a good way to boost my career prospects as a technology consultant. Since I‚Äôve only started speaking at conferences about six months ago, I think it‚Äôs too early to expect to see any tangible benefit from it yet. One way conference speaking has intangibly benefited me though is that I can now list in my bio that I‚Äôve spoken at certain conferences like RubyConf India which I think carries a lot of weight among my peers, and I can truthfully say that I‚Äôm an ‚Äúinternational speaker‚Äù.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at a regional conference called DevOpsDays Midwest in St. Louis, Missouri in September 2018. Since I had already been speaking at local user groups for years before that point, this speaking gig didn‚Äôt feel like too big of a jump up. I‚Äôm happy to say that as far as I can tell, the talk went fine.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to many dozens of conferences. I‚Äôve spoken at five conferences at the time of this interview with two more conference talks coming up, for a total of seven. I‚Äôve been accepted to more conferences than that but sometimes I can‚Äôt go because there‚Äôs a schedule conflict or the travel expense is too much to justify at the time.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have a pre-talk routine. I rehearse beforehand but on the day of the talk I just get up and do it.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I only have one piece of advice: If getting a talk proposal accepted seems like an unattainable goal, just keep sending in proposals and you‚Äôll probably eventually get something accepted.</p>\n<p>I had to submit dozens of proposals before I finally got a talk accepted, at least a talk at a conference I was able to attend. At this point I‚Äôve actually gotten more talks accepted than I can take on and I‚Äôve had to throttle back on sending in proposals. The act of giving my first talk gave me a couple ideas for my next talk. My next talk gave me several more ideas for future talks, and so on. The more I submitted proposals and the more I spoke, the easier it all got.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I think part of my motivation for speaking at conferences was seeing the success that my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlainChautard\">Alain Chautard</a> has had with it and seeing the impact speaking has had on his consulting career.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJwvmuK4tQw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alain Chautard at NG Conf 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

I‚Äôve seen several of\nKeanan‚Äôs talks including one about Alexa and another about serverless functions in PHP. Keanan also has an entrepreneurial\nspirit, which I appreciate, so it was great to learn more about his experience speaking.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mcsi3b6.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi I‚Äôm Keanan and I‚Äôm a developer-turned-CTO and I co-founded <a href=\"https://alphaparticle.com/\">Alpha Particle</a>, a digital consultancy in Chicago. I got into public speaking at one of my previous jobs when we decided that our company should get more involved in the development community. So I started reading up on exactly how conferences decided on talks and started submitting to CFPs!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy all the people I‚Äôve been able to meet as a result of the speaking that I‚Äôve done. <strong>I especially enjoy chatting with people at the speaker dinners or other informal events surrounding the conference.</strong> As far as benefits to my career, some of these connections I‚Äôve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs, new clients and even (arguably) this interview.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at WordCamp Nashville in 2016. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/03/17/keanan-koppenhaver-take-wp-admin-to-the-next-level-with-advanced-custom-fields/\">video is actually online</a>, though I cringe watching it. It was a 20 minute ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù and I remember having to follow an awesome speaker who had the audience on the edge of their seat the entire time. The majority of my talk actually went well, but near the end (~14:00) you can see my heart jump up into my throat when one of my demos didn‚Äôt work correctly! Luckily, I was able to fix it and finish the talk, and <strong>this definitely wasn‚Äôt the last time demos didn‚Äôt work exactly right</strong>.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Between conferences and meetups, I‚Äôve probably spoken at between 20-30 and applied to probably twice that many. I don‚Äôt really apply to conferences that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd be a great fit for, but even then sometimes they just really can‚Äôt take everybody.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><em>Cue Eye of the Tiger montage‚Ä¶</em></p>\n<p>But seriously, I usually just try to get into the room I‚Äôll be speaking in before I have to give my talk (either by getting to the conference early in the morning or during lunch) and make sure my computer can interface with the projector and that the fonts on my slides are readable even in the back of the room.</p>\n<p><strong>I always try to attend the talk before mine in the same room</strong>, just so I can start setting up and doing a final check of everything as soon as the last presenter is done with their talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think there‚Äôs definitely lots of feelings from new speakers around not being knowledgeable enough to start speaking. <strong>But if a conference was only filled with super-advanced talks, they would lose a huge part of their audience.</strong> So, even if you just learned something, you can teach it and many attendees will welcome your perspective as a relatively-recent beginner. <strong>Since you just went through it all for the first time yourself, you know and remember all the roadblocks that someone getting started will have and can help them learn even quicker.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to that, the one thing that started really getting me more speaking opportunities is <strong>submitting multiple talks to each CFP</strong>. Conference organizers sometimes have an agenda of the talks they‚Äôre looking to accept and if you submit more talks, you give them more chances to fit you into the schedule they‚Äôre looking to craft. (However, some conferences specifically say to not submit more than X talks, so definitely abide by that.)</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garybernhardt\">Gary Bernhardt</a>, specifically <a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript\">Wat and The Birth and Death of Javascript</a> just because he manages to inject lots of humor into his talks while still keeping them super informative. I also loved <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en\">Tim Urban on Procrastination</a> just because of both his graphics and the way he walks the audience through his talk.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

In addition to that, he has a fantastic story about\nhow he accidentally fell into speaking, so read on to learn more about Alex and his tips for technical speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FDVubKV.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>About 8 years ago, I was a JavaScript Test Developer working for an outsourcer in Romania (I happen to be Romanian), contracting for Mozilla. A friend was organizing this conference called Open Source Open Mind and wanted someone from our team to come to speak about Mozilla and how to get involved. I was terrified of public speaking, but luckily one of my coworkers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ioana_cis\">Ioana</a>, said she‚Äôd do it. Ioana was in the US at a client on-site just before the conference though, so she asked me to do the slides for her. Naively, I accepted, thinking there‚Äôs no harm in it and it‚Äôs the least I could do since she was getting me out of having to be on stage.</p>\n<p>The day of the conference rolls around, and we‚Äôre all in the airport early in the morning, waiting for Ioana‚Äôs flight to land. Just as the airport was listing her flight as ‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù, we got a message from Ioana to go ahead to the conference, and stall as much as possible, she‚Äôll be on the next flight and should be there in time for the last slot of the day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pensacolla\">Marcela</a>, the conference organizer, being a friend, kept pushing Ioana‚Äôs talk further in the schedule. But the last talk of the day comes up, and Ioana is nowhere to be found. So Marcela goes up on stage and looks panicked at the audience, sees me in the front row, and just blurts out: ‚ÄúAnd now, talking about the Mozilla community‚Ä¶Alex is going to talk about the Mozilla community!‚Äú.</p>\n<p>I was dumbstruck, I got on stage and I just sat there quietly for about a minute. And then I started talking and didn‚Äôt stop until the Q&#x26;A part. It was horrible, I had my hands in my pocket the entire time, I made a bunch of rookie mistakes. There is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMnwjpy_3J0\">video of it</a> somewhere on youtube, luckily in Romanian, so not very popular. To this day I still use it as an example of ‚Äòwhat not to do‚Äô during my public speaking training. üòÖ</p>\n<p>When the Q&#x26;A part came, people were a bit on edge, and every time someone bashed Firefox with their questions, I took a step into the audience. I think I finished the Q&#x26;A part literally in the middle of the audience, and trying to make a step to my left to go towards the last person that asked a question. That‚Äôs when I realized maybe it was time to end the talk, well over my allotted time slot.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs how I started speaking in public. A few weeks after that I was MCing one of the community events we had going, someone from the Mozilla Community team saw me and decided that‚Äôs what I was going to do moving forward. I got tons of mentorship from the Mozilla people, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a>, as I was starting out and it just encouraged me to get better and be on stage more often than in the audience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The reason I speak at conferences is simple. I feel guilty about being privileged enough to have gone to a Computer Science University, so <strong>I try as much as possible to help other people get into tech, or get better at tech</strong>. Knowing I helped at least one person by being on stage and sharing my knowledge makes me feel a bit better about that.</p>\n<p>I used to think public speaking was making me a better communicator, so it was helping me indirectly in my career as a JavaScript Developer. But about two years ago I got a job as a JavaScript Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://developer.nexmo.com/team\">Nexmo</a>, and my community work and public speaking was the reason I got the job. So it helped me directly in my career, to the point its part of my day to day work! üòÖ</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mWBqS30hoI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alex Lakatos at View Source</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt really have an exact number, but let‚Äôs go with ‚Äúa lot‚Äù. For context, last year I‚Äôve either spoken, attended, hosted or sponsored 40 events (not just conferences, but smaller meetups as well). If I had to venture a guess based on my slides repo on Github, I‚Äôd say <strong>I spoke at around 50 conferences and meetups so far</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, and it‚Äôs a little embarrassing, to be honest. <strong>I get so nervous before going on stage that I can‚Äôt eat, drink or interact with people.</strong> There is this Psychology of Winning that tells you how to get into a winner mindset, and that calms down my nerves enough to get on stage and start talking. After the first minute or so practice takes over and I actually enjoy being on stage but let me tell you about getting there.</p>\n<p><strong>I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won</strong> (dunno what, but the point is I‚Äôm a winner now!): pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few ‚ÄúHell yeah!‚Äús if I think the toilet it empty (spoiler alert: it rarely is as empty as I think). That makes me think I just won something, I don‚Äôt need to win on stage as well, and it calms my nerves enough so I don‚Äôt shake as I speak.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There are so many things I can list, it‚Äôll just end up being another blog post just for this question. I think there are a lot more resources out there now compared to when I started, so <strong>my advice is just ‚Äúpractice‚Äù. No one did great the first time they got on stage or the second one, but practice makes perfect.</strong> So look at your presentations, identify the areas you could have done better (be it slides, content, posture, delivery), and then find the next conference or meetup where you can practice your talk some more and improve on those points.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for resources on public speaking or want to take the plunge and become a Developer Advocate, I co-curated this newsletter called ‚ÄúDeveloper Avocados ü•ë Weekly‚Äù. If you <a href=\"http://developeravocados.net/\">subscribe</a>, you get a bunch of highly curated articles from the past week in your inbox every Monday, along with a few conferences CFPs that support speakers with travel and accommodation.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>When I started out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertnyman\">Robert Nyman</a> helped me and inspired me a lot.</p>\n<p>Today, I think one of my favorite speakers is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simona_cotin/\">Simona Cotin</a>. I like her Serverless talks a lot, the live coding with a fallback to recordings is something I keep telling people they should do more of in their talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTrHSQbxR-Y' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Simona Cotin at JAMStack</em>conf 2018_</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pUB2xtQ.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I‚Äôm Joe! I‚Äôve been in tech for a very long time, and giving talks at conferences for maybe five years. I‚Äôm very much a generalist, so I take a lot of different roles in tech. Overall, though, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve been most interested in making teams more effective lately.</p>\n<p><strong>I was originally on the fence about whether I should give a talk. Too nervous.</strong> While grabbing drinks with someone much more experienced than myself, she basically told me to get over it and just apply. That turned out to be great advice. Since then I‚Äôve given a ton of talks, both soft topics and purely technical ones.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôve been incredibly fortunate to get to meet and become friends with some of my heroes in the industry as a result of speaking at conferences.</strong> That‚Äôs probably the biggest benefit for me. The Ruby community ‚Äî where I give most of my talks ‚Äî is full of supportive, brilliant folks, so that‚Äôs really made me feel good about participating.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs definitely impacted my career. <strong>I still get folks coming to talk to me about talks I gave a few years ago.</strong> I can point to videos of my talks when talking to companies or folks inside my own company. And it let me sharpen my own thinking and discussion skills around tech topics. It‚Äôs been a huge boon.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFuzIWz6Ynk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Joe speaking at Rails Conf, 2017</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Honestly I don‚Äôt think I slept for three days before my first talk. One of the reasons I enjoy giving talks is that I get to work on my fear of speaking in front of crowds. That said, <strong>I always struggle right before I actually get on stage.</strong> I was at a single track conference in a theatre auditorium, which made me feel even more nervous.</p>\n<p>But once I was on stage, I was able to get into a rhythm and really get across the ideas I wanted to convey. And at some point I remembered that I do know and care about my topic deeply. That gave me a lot of confidence. I‚Äôd say it was a success.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to a few dozen. I‚Äôve been accepted at maybe a quarter of those that I applied to? <strong>I have a much easier time getting accepted at regional and US-based conferences.</strong> I‚Äôd really like to do more international speaking, but I think I probably need to have more visibility domestically and focus more on that goal before it‚Äôll happen. I‚Äôm also much more comfortable in communities that I feel attached to (Ruby) than general programming conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Panic? Honestly, I usually spend the morning of a talk walking back and forth clicking through my slides and making sure that I have the major points from that slide down cold. I‚Äôve never been good at preparing to the point where I‚Äôve got my entire talk scripted, so that‚Äôs helpful for me as a routine.</p>\n<p>I probably should script my entire talks, but that‚Äôs not really my speed.</p>\n<p><strong>I do wear the same t-shirt nearly every time I give a talk. That‚Äôs pretty much a ritual at this point.</strong></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Ignore the fear and just apply.</strong></p>\n<p>I can totally understand the impostor syndrome, it‚Äôs hard to make the transition from an audience member to a speaker. It‚Äôs a bit cliche, but I do try to help new speakers remember that <strong>the things that they learned in the past year are totally new material to others</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôd definitely recommend taking advantage of any speaker help that conferences offer.</strong> It‚Äôs a huge boon to get people to listen to your talk ahead of time. There are also lots of articles out there on how to write a good proposal. Overall, let other peoples‚Äô hard won wisdom get you through the early parts.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve had the fortune or misfortune to speak on the same stage as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandimetz\">Sandi Metz</a> before. The clarity of how she conveys deep technical ideas always blows my mind. She‚Äôs definitely the person whose style I‚Äôd like to get better at emulating. If I would just start scripting my talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzWLGMtXflg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Sandi Metz at RubyConf 2017</em></p>\n<p>That said, there are plenty of other speakers with really different styles who all convey ideas really effectively, in really different ways. Say, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nick Means</a> versus <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searls\">Justin Searls</a>. You can‚Äôt take someone else‚Äôs voice, and you don‚Äôt need to.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>No conferences on the books now as I‚Äôm adjusting to a new job and hoping to take advantage of being in a company to get more opportunity to give talks.

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>After being reluctant (and admittedly nervous) to get on stage as a speaker, Nicola was finally\nconvinced that her experience was worth sharing. Her story is inspiring, because as Nicola points\nout, there aren‚Äôt a ton of speakers like her (Australian, female designers) out there.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm an independent product design consultant, working with software teams on their research and design as well as their process. I‚Äôm Australian, but I travel around a lot now days.</p>\n<p>I really had to force myself into public speaking. <strong>I was that girl who was so nervous I felt sick when I had to answer a question in class in front of people in high school.</strong> I was so shy and scared of public speaking. I never, ever thought I‚Äôd be speaking at conferences one day.</p>\n<p>I was lucky later on that I had a manager (Lawrence Crowther) who kept suggesting I give a talk. I think the fact that he saw me as someone who should be on stage was what I needed to feel like I could do it. Then the guy who runs Web Directions in Sydney reached out to me on Twitter after some blog posts I wrote, and specifically said he‚Äôd love to see my application to speak at the conference coming up. They promised speaker training for anyone who wanted it, so I went ahead and applied. Lo and behold, I was accepted‚Ä¶ So then I had to force myself to get comfortable with public speaking in a matter of a few months.</p>\n<p>I really appreciate both of these people for believing I was the right person to be on stage, and encouraging me to do it. <strong>I think to get less represented people on stage, we really need to just ask them more.</strong> It‚Äôs hard to imagine yourself on stage if you‚Äôve never really seen someone like you doing it. I didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd seen many young, Aussie, female designers doing talks, so I guess it just didn‚Äôt really seem like something I could do.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qTCPnIX.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The two things I‚Äôve spoken about most - retrospectives and collaborative user research - are both things I‚Äôm really passionate about. So it‚Äôs just exciting to be able to share information I really think people should have.</p>\n<p>On a more selfish level, <strong>its great to be able to speak about the thing you‚Äôre interested in in front of a lot of people, because it means for the rest of the conference the other people who share your passion will come up and talk to you.</strong> I‚Äôve met some really interesting people. And having spoken about your field at conferences gives you a little boost of initial authority on the subject that you otherwise have to build from scratch every time you meet a new client.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I tested out that my laptop connection and slides were working so many times in the break before my talk that they had to shoo me off stage. And still, the connection totally failed when I got up there in front of 800 people. The AV guy had to actually restart my computer on stage while I was standing there introducing myself at length. Super awkward! But I feel like I swallowed the frog: the possibly worst thing happened the first time. It all had to be uphill from there.</p>\n<p>(For the record, the talk went fine once we got the slides working again!)</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve spoken at 3 conferences, with #4 coming up in June. Two in Sydney one in Kingston, Jamaica (!) and the next in Cornwall in the UK. I‚Äôve applied to a lot more than that!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5mC7jQ3Lto' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Nicola Rushton at WebCraftConf - User Research is for Everyone</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I always try and test out the talk on a real audience or two before the conference.</strong> Whether that‚Äôs at a workplace or a Meetup, I always find things to change and get feedback from people. I will practice my talk probably ten or more times in the few weeks before the conference, just in my house talking to the walls!</p>\n<p>Directly on the day of the talk, I don‚Äôt have much of a routine. If anyone asks me about how I‚Äôm feeling I tell them ‚Äúexcited!‚Äù Even if I‚Äôm actually totally nervous, I find that embodying excitement helps me feel that way. I normally don‚Äôt eat much on the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The most useful thing I have ever been told regarding public speaking was that <strong>the intense rush of adrenaline and nerves before you get on stage is COMPLETELY NORMAL and it happens to everyone, even people who‚Äôve been doing it for years</strong>. In fact, if it stops happening, there‚Äôs something wrong. When I felt like that before, I used to get kind of worried and feel like maybe it would cause me to shake or faint on stage or something. But now I just observe that feeling and think to myself, awesome. My body is giving me all the adrenaline and hormones to do an awesome job of this. And I know it doesn‚Äôt come across on stage (especially if you smile!)</p>\n<p><strong>Think about starting by talking at Meetups, being on panels, or even hosting a Meetup.</strong> Smaller moments of being on stage helped me feel comfortable building up to standing up and speaking for 45 minutes straight.</p>\n<p>I think it‚Äôs also worth saying that representation on stage can be really useful for other people in the audience. Seeing people like you doing things can make someone reconsider whether they might be the right person to do that thing too. <strong>Just by being up there and being yourself you could be encouraging someone else to get up and share the thing they‚Äôre passionate about too.</strong> I find this perspective valuable if I start to feel imposter syndrome.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>One of the most useful things I did for myself when forcing myself to become comfortable with public speaking was to <strong>hold myself to a low standard</strong>.</p>\n<p>That might sound really counterintuitive, but I just told myself at the start that if I got on stage, said everything I wanted to say, and didn‚Äôt trip over myself, then it would be a huge success. Then the next time, I pushed myself to do all of that and one more thing. Then the next time, just a tiny bit better. This allowed me to always feel REALLY positive and successful and happy about my public speaking. I didn‚Äôt want to get into feeling like I didn‚Äôt do good enough, and become discouraged. So really, my goal is to just be myself on stage, have good content, and communicate what I want to communicate in an engaging way.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt compare myself to anyone else!</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://nicolarushton.com/\">www.nicolarushton.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicolarushton\">Nicola on Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/nicola-rushton/\">Nicola on Linkedin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My next conference talk is in <a href=\"https://agileonthebeach.com/sessions/2019/bring-the-team-along-for-the-ride-why-products-are-better-when-agile-teams-do-research-together/\">June at Agile on the Beach, UK</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Nicola Rushton, Overcoming Reluctance to Share Her Passion","path":"/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/04/12","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1npb2OhWZlDsfQEdUPaQu8uTrigII2--w"}}}],"pathPrefix":"blog","first":false,"last":false,"index":4,"pageCount":5,"additionalContext":{}}}
