{"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"group":[{"post":{"html":"<p>This week, I released three new features to newsletter subscribers that should improve your experience with CFP Land: Category Preferences, 🔔 New tags, and Perks.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>Category Preferences</h2>\n<p>The most requested feature so far has been the ability for subscribers to choose a preferred category. Each week, the CFP Land newsletter contains more than 30 conferences, so it’s really annoying to sift through all of them looking for the few you really care about. For that reason, each email you get now includes a link to “Update Your Preferences”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sp9mq2c.png\" alt=\"Update your preferences in the weekly email\"></p>\n<p>This will take you to form where you can specify the category of conferences you prefer:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iibk8D7.png\" alt=\"Category preference form\"></p>\n<p>Each week, any CFPs matching your preferred category should show up at the top of your email:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3utX9jM.png\" alt=\"Preferred CFPs\"></p>\n<p>Location preferences aren’t quite ready yet, but they will be coming soon!</p>\n<h2>“New” Tags</h2>\n<p>Another way to pick out new CFPs from the weekly email is to focus on any that are new. The list is sorted by CFP end date, so usually new ones will be at the bottom, but occasionally I’ll add a conference CFP just before it closes. In this case, it will show up marked with the ”🔔 New” tag. This means the conference has been added since the last email was sent 7 days ago:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sp9mq2c.png\" alt=\"New tag indicates a conference has been added in the past 7 days\"></p>\n<h2>Perks for Speakers</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’m spending extra time each week looking for the “Perks” that each conference offers to speakers (hopefully I’ll be able to automate this eventually). This was another highly requested feature, and it definitely helps if you’re trying to prioritize conferences that will cover travel or hotel costs for you.</p>\n<p>Right now the perks I look for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Travel</strong> meaning that the conference will pay for your travel to and from the event.</li>\n<li><strong>Hotel</strong> indicates that the conference offers reimbursement for hotel costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Stipend</strong> is an offer for payment or extra cash to cover miscellaneous expenses while speaking. Not many conferences offer this, so it’s nice when they do!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because my resources are limited, I only include these perks when they are <strong>clearly listed</strong> on the conference’s website page for speakers. If I miss something, you can always email me to let me know. Also, I decided not to include whether a free ticket for the event was included because <em>almost</em> every conference includes this by default.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/P03MMW4.png\" alt=\"Perks like travel, hotel, and stipend are included in each email\"></p>\n<p>That’s it for this month’s new features. All new subscribers are asked to fill out a feedback form, so if you’d like to see improvements, keep an eye out for that email after you subscribe or contact me (<a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a>) to start a conversation.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"New Features: Category Preferences, \"New\" Tags, and Perks","path":"/blog/category-preferences-perks/","category":"Updates","tags":["Email","Website"],"date":"2019/04/05","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

She was recently featured as a <a href=\"https://www.asianentrepreneur.org/women-on-top-in-tech-laura-janusek-vice-president-of-product-and-founding-team-member-of-modern-teacher/\">“Woman on Top in\nTech”</a> by Asian Entrepreneur magazine, and has been involved in public speaking for\nmany years. In this interview, we cover how she got into speaking at tech\nconferences, her advice for new speakers, and some of the ways speaking has\nbenefited her professionally.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0KSCAln6MEJrW0a3URY6ow.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’ve become a more active speaker at technical conferences just in the last\nyear. Over the past several years, I would speak here and there, generally after\nbeing invited by someone involved with the event. But last year I was looking\ninto conferences I might want to attend for women in tech, and I saw a CFP on\nthe website for one of them. I thought, “Oh, maybe instead of just attending\nthese conferences, I could speak at them,” and I was right!</p>\n<p>I wish I had realized sooner that <strong>you don’t always have to be personally\ninvited to speak at events.</strong> Now that I’m aware of the CFP process, I’m\nspeaking regularly at conferences across the country.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences? Has it benefited your career?</h3>\n<p>I think conferences can be such a fun way to meet people, whether you’re\nspeaking or not. But I have to admit, being a speaker has its perks. There are\ndinners, networking events, sometimes lounges specifically for the speakers,\nwhich build an immediate sense of community. I’ve been blown away by some of the\nother speakers I’ve met in these settings.</p>\n<p>Speaking also establishes your authority in your subject area, and it gives you\nthe chance to genuinely help people learn something new. This teaching aspect is\nespecially important to me, given my background in the education space.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Being in EdTech, I’ve always spoken at events for teachers, which was a natural\nprogression from being in the classroom and participating in or leading\nprofessional development sessions. But my first speaking engagement that was for\nmore of a technical and business-oriented audience was on a panel of EdTech\nentrepreneurs at <a href=\"https://1871.com/\">Chicago’s tech incubator and hub, 1871</a>.\nOne of the organizers had seen me giving a product demo and asked for me to join\nthe event, perhaps to help them avoid the dreaded all-male panel (or “manel”).</p>\n<p>And again, this experience corrected some misconceptions I had about public\nspeaking. I used to think all panelists must be exceptional at coming up with\noff-the-cuff responses to tricky questions on the spot, and maybe some of them\nare, but that’s definitely not the norm.</p>\n<p>In my experience at the 1871’s event, the panelists were all given the questions\nahead of time so we could prepare, and I was asked if I’d be comfortable kicking\nthe panel off by responding to the first question. I didn’t need to worry about\ncoming up with responses in the moment, because I was prepped ahead of time,\nwhich made the experience a lot less intimidating. And the format of a panel —\nbeing seated, one in a row of several speakers — creates a more casual vibe as\nwell. <strong>I’d definitely recommend panels as a gateway experience for anyone who\nis considering branching out into public speaking.</strong></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve spoken at about 10 conferences to date, and I currently have 4 more\nscheduled in the coming months. I don’t keep count on how many I’ve applied to,\nbut it’s been a lot! <strong>I definitely don’t get accepted to every event — I don’t\nthink anyone does.</strong> But I’ve very much enjoyed the conferences I’ve been a part\nof, and I’m looking forward to the ones ahead.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I try to access the room some time before my session to make sure the AV setup\nis good to go, but apart from that, I’m usually attending someone else’s session\nright up until it’s time for mine to start!</p>\n<p>I know not everyone’s schedules allow them to spend the full day at the event,\nbut <strong>I think it’s a shame when speakers come in just for their session and then\nleave.</strong> I make it a point to support and learn from the other speakers when I’m\nat a conference, so my session is usually one of many that I participate in\nthroughout the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>My biggest piece of advice is to just go for it!</p>\n<p>I’m involved in a lot of online communities, and I’ll see people posting in\nSlack, asking if they should respond to a CFP they’re interested in. My response\nis always yes. Why not? <strong>It doesn’t take much to respond to a CFP. You don’t\nhave to have a whole session ready to go. You just need an idea and an\nabstract.</strong></p>\n<p>Think of something you’ve been successful at professionally, and then think of\nwhat advice you’d give to others on that topic. Can you come up with 5–10 tips\nto make your audience better at X? A coding language, a new tool, even a soft\nskill? Then you’ve got enough to respond to a CFP.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of resources on writing strong CFP submissions, so I’d recommend\ndoing a little research in that area, but <strong>don’t be intimidated, especially if\nyou’re a member of an underrepresented group. Conferences need more\nrepresentation of diversity and inclusion.</strong> Go for it!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers who have inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One that comes to mind is Jennifer Wesley at Google, who gave the opening\nremarks at the Women Techmakers Summit in Chicago for International Women’s Day\nrecently. She stands out to me because she was able to get personal on stage,\nand in doing so, she established that the summit was a safe space for women.\n<strong>By being willing to be a little vulnerable with her personal story, she set\nthe tone for the whole day.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/95g2cd8pwe8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Jennifer Wesley at TEDxParker speaking about women in STEM</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I always post about my upcoming sessions on\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LBJanusek\">Twitter</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbjanusek/\">LinkedIn</a>, and I share speaker\ndiscounts there when I can, so follow or connect with me if you’re interested.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Laura Janusek, Chief Product Officer in Educational Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/03/31","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0KSCAln6MEJrW0a3URY6ow.jpeg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

One of the things I love about speaking at conferences is the\nopportunity to meet people from all over the world, so reading Geshan’s\nexperience as a speaker on multiple continents was inspiring.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*mQ216JZETiJBtVpHdGLBkA.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>Tell me about yourself? How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I have been a software engineer for more than a decade now. I have worked as a\nsoftware engineer in 3 countries in the past 10 years. I am primarily a backend\nsoftware engineer who dabbles in the frontend side of things once in a while.</p>\n<p>I used to do public speaking even in 2010 but I restarted doing it in 2014 when\nI spoke at a meetup in Kathmandu, Nepal. Then I started sending out abstract to\nCFPs in 2015, and in 2016 I spoke at my first conference: Code Motion Dubai.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like meeting like-minded people with the profession in common. All of us are\nsolution providers at the end of the day at times with code and sometimes\nwithout code too. I like the positive energy conferences have and regardless of\nwhere you work or the number of years of experience one has all of the\nparticipants are there to learn and share the experience. I admire the time,\neffort and resources put in by speakers for their talk.</p>\n<p>Public speaking, to be honest, has benefited my career both directly and\nindirectly. It has surely given me recognition and many people have approached\nme after doing some public speaking for various reasons. To be honest, adding a\nsection in your CV where you have spoken in a couple of good conferences does\nadd more value.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>My first big conference talk was in August, 2016 in Amsterdam for Laracon EU.\nProbably that was the biggest audience I had spoken in front of and included all\nthe who’s who of that community. It was a talk on ChatOps and I think for that\ncommunity of people it was a relatively new thing then.</p>\n<p><span class=\"figcaption_hack\">Geshan’s first big conference talk at Laracon EU, 2016</span></p>\n<p>I think it went pretty well, I was shaky and nervous when I started of course\nand then after the first 10 minutes I think I was in the flow and telling most\nof the things I had to talk about.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, I have lost count on how many CFPs I have submitted my abstracts,\nfrom 2015 it surely should be in the 100s. I generally submit to conferences\nthat cover both travel and accommodations or at least travel. Like an e-commerce\nwebsite, I believe (at least for me) the conversion (success) rate is like 1% or\nless :). In total from 2016 to now I have spoken at 4 conferences in 4\ncontinents, not sure if it qualifies me to be called an international speaker\nfrom Nepal though :).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I narrate the talk to myself the night before. Then right before the talk, I\nmake sure I have things I need with me like water, screen connections, and that\nthe screen size is fine. After I get on stage, I focus on delivering the message\nwith the right impact.</p>\n<p>I try to keep preparation pretty simple: don’t over-prepare, keep things\nspontaneous, but have some direction and keep an eye on the time.</p>\n<p>I usually don’t have speaker notes so I look at the slides and then improvise on\nthem. That’s why even if I do the same talk a second time, the details I include\neach time will be different.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For new speakers, there are two main pieces of advice:</p>\n<p><strong>First, give your talk on local meetups.</strong> Local user group meetups are always\nlooking for speakers so if you approach them you will rarely hear a no you can’t\npresent. Depending on your city, the frequency of meetups in your area of tech\nmight be many, little, or none. When you practice your talk in a smaller group\nyou get feedback and also get over imposter syndrome.</p>\n<p>Speaking is not a thing for everyone, so try it in a smaller group. If you like\nit do it more, but bare in mind public speaking is a very important skill for\nyour career.</p>\n<p><strong>The second one is to work on your title and abstract.</strong> When conferences have\nCFPs the main thing in my opinion that stands out is your title and abstract.\nThe relevance of the talk in that conference is vital too, for instance, a Ruby\nconference will never accept a PHP 7 features talk. As some conferences have\nblind speaker selection, always work an extra bit on your title and abstracts.</p>\n<p>Then, it’s all about submitting your talk to all the CFPs you can find. The best\nway to find CFPs is <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">confs.tech</a>,\nlanyrd.com (it’s usually down though),\n<a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">callingallpapers.com</a>.

In my former life I was an active member of the debate team and did a\nlot of musical theatre, so audiences don’t scare me. I decided I wanted to be\ninvolved in technical speaking in part because I wanted to see more diversity\nrepresented on the stage.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*fM3yLcP58eVXUsdeHAnVdA.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>There is so much to love about speaking.</p>\n<p>I like thinking up the talk subject and coming up with something I think is new\nor interesting that will benefit attendees. While writing talks are a huge time\ncommitment, there is nothing quite like explaining a concept to others to help\ncrystalize it in your mind.</p>\n<p>And, speaking is an incredible way to connect with other people outside of your\ntech silo and/or geographic area. It has also opened up additional career\nopportunities for me, and has resulted in growing in different directions as\nwell, like writing blog posts and answering interview questions!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do! It was a local first year conference. I think the talk was meant to be 20\nminutes or so and I was overly concerned about running short.</p>\n<p>It went pretty well, and people laughed at my jokes, but I was far more nervous\nthan I’d expected to be.
