Now that I’m aware of the CFP process, I’m speaking regularly at conferences across the country.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/\">Laura Janusek</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there is variability in how an event decides on which speakers they will invite, most technology conferences offer some form of public Call for Proposals (“CFP”). When conference organizers start planning their event, they usually choose a date, and soon after, they will open up a CFP. The CFP may be managed on a platform like <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">Sessionize</a> or <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">PaperCall</a> and promoted through channels like <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com\">CFP Land</a>.</p>\n<p><em>More tips for finding CFPs are available in <a href=\"../finding-cfps/\">Section 4: Finding and Selecting CFPs</a>.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to accepting public submissions, many conferences will invite specific speakers - especially those they’ve identified as possible keynote speakers. It takes a while to get recognized as a possible keynote speaker, and by that point, you’ll likely have met many of the conference organizers already. So, most speakers start by submitting their talk proposals to open CFPs.</p>\n<p>Because most conferences get hundreds of submissions, they use an orderly process to evaluate and select talks. I’ve heard of conferences using one or more of the following methods, but others may also exist:</p>\n<h3>1. Rolling Review</h3>\n<p>Some conferences start reviewing submissions as soon as they come in. This helps the reviewers keep from getting overwhelmed by evaluating hundreds of submissions all at once, but it means that the conference may not have enough spots for late submissions. Sometimes conferences will advertise that they evaluate submissions on a rolling basis, but many do not, so if you’re really serious you might want to email the organizers to ask.</p>\n<p>In the case of rolling reviews, it pays to submit your abstract or proposal early.</p>\n<h3>2. Public Voting</h3>\n<p>Other conferences open up all submissions to public opinion. I’ve usually seen this in the form of an open voting period, so speakers are expected to help promote their session. The upside to the conference is that they build community awareness for the event, and have an easier time selecting talks. The downside is that voters may or may not actually attend the conference, and they may not select a diverse range of topics or speakers. Usually, the conference organizers will mix open voting with some personal selections to ensure a good balance.</p>\n<h3>3. Post-Deadline Review</h3>\n<p>The majority of conference organizers I’ve spoken to wait until all submissions are turned in and the deadline has passed before reviewing them. While this creates a huge backlog of abstracts to review, it allows the organizers to ensure a good mix of talks and not give any preference to early submissions. In this case, submitting early won’t help you, but you really need to work hard to make your proposal stand out.</p>\n<h2>Notifying and Confirming Speakers</h2>\n<p>Sometime after the review process ends (or during it in the case of rolling review), the conference organizers will reach out individually to each speaker they’ve selected. Because speakers often apply months before they hear back, the organizers want to confirm that the speaker is still interested and available. If not, they may invite another speaker to replace them.</p>\n<p>This is the reason that conferences are typically very slow to send rejection emails - if they send them at all. But it also means that even if a conference starts to announce speakers, they aren’t necessarily done with the selection process. You may still have hope!</p>\n<p><em>More on handling success and rejection is available in <a href=\"../success-rejection/\">Section 6: Dealing with Success or Rejection</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Why Do Speakers Get Chosen?</h2>\n<p>Assuming the conference is not using public voting to select speakers, it’s almost impossible to predict exactly what will stand out to a conference organizing committee. Each one is different, and each conference has different stated (and unstated) objectives. It certainly helps if you have been to the conference before (or have seen the sessions they selected in the past), but even then, things can change.</p>\n<p>While there are many factors involved, technology conference speakers are usually chosen based on some combination of the following criteria:</p>\n<h3>1. Great Topic and Abstract</h3>\n<p>Writing a great conference proposal (or abstract) is an art. It takes a mix of skills - writing, storytelling, and creativity among them - but a great abstract for one conference won’t necessarily work at another. The most successful speakers submit multiple abstracts and tailor each to the conference they’re targeting.</p>\n<p><em>Much more on writing and submitting a successful abstract is available in <a href=\"../submitting/\">Section 5: Submitting Abstracts</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>2. A Good Blend of Topics</h3>\n<p>Most conferences want a mix of sessions because attendees are often looking for different things. Some want to be inspired by the big-picture sessions and keynotes; others want to learn specific niche technologies from experts; others are just curious, and want to know what’s trending.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having big-picture sessions can make for a very generic program. As such, a limited number of big-picture presentations tend to get picked with a larger number of more specialist topics.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Experienced organizers usually shoot for a good blend so they can maximize the value to attendees.</p>\n<h3>3. Speaker Reputation</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0F3l9Qh.jpg\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Famous speakers will tend to attract money, in the form of more/better sponsors and more attendees.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Developing a reputation as a speaker takes time, but once you’ve done it, organizers will likely give you a leg up over new speakers. It’s not fair, but it makes some sense - there’s always a risk that a first-time speaker will get too nervous and flake out before the event - plus widely known speakers may actually draw an audience on their own.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The biggest conferences may have selection processes that favor experienced speakers, since they don’t want to risk a 50-minute time slot on an unknown quantity.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the same time, conference organizers are annoyed by overly self-promoting talks too. Speakers who can’t stop talking about themselves will gain a negative reputation that’s just as hard to overcome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Program committees often don’t want ego-ridden sessions, not just because they are annoying, but also because they often become advertising carousels for the speaker’s books, videos, events, and other material they are schlepping.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Speaker Qualifications</h3>\n<p>Just because a speaker is new does not mean that they don’t know what they’re talking about. I’ve met a lot of speakers with 20+ years of experience in their field, so it’s pretty safe to say they’re qualified to give a talk - even if they haven’t before. That said, even qualified speakers need to show the organizers that they’re qualified in some way, so writing blog posts, books, or courses can be a good way to demonstrate your knowledge even before you start speaking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Why should I listen to them? Are they an amazing speaker and will give a great performance? Are they an expert in a field that they can speak authoritatively on? Do they have some unique experience that makes their content special or different?…Did you win “best comedic presentation” at your local toastmasters? Were you in every theatre play and musical production in school? Did you write an open-source tool or library that deals heavily with the topics involved? Have you spoken before?\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>5. Diversity of Speakers</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are many that simply won’t see what’s in front of their eyes. They are completely unaware of how unwelcoming many technical events are for those with diverse backgrounds. There is a reason it is like it is.\n<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DBAKevlar/status/1166767440547549184\">Kellyn Command Line</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Speaker diversity comes in many forms, but some examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Training and education</li>\n<li>Race and ethnicity</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\n<li>Socioeconomic background</li>\n<li>Company and team size</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While some organizers ignore speaker diversity, it is <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">becoming a bigger issue for many conferences and speakers</a>.</p>\n<h3>6. Cost of Transportation and Hotel</h3>\n<p>If the conference offers perks like free travel and hotel for speakers, they often must consider this cost when selecting speakers. In other words, even if your abstract is great, some small conferences won’t be able to fly you halfway across the world just to speak. You can get around this limitation if you (or your employer) are willing to cover the cost, so be sure to mention that in your application.</p>\n<h3>7. Event Sponsorship</h3>\n<p>Finally, some technology conferences give dedicated speaking slots to sponsors. If you work in developer relations or you’re hiring a lot of people, your employer may be willing to sponsor some events in exchange for some stage time.</p>\n<p>Now that you’re familiar with how conferences choose speakers, it’s time to find some open calls for proposals (CFPs). The next section covers this in-depth as well as some of the ways you can ensure the event you’re applying to is worth your time.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../why-speak/\">Previous: Why Speak? 11 Reasons People Get on Stage</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../finding-cfps/\">Next: Finding and Selecting CFPs</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"How Conferences Choose Their Speakers","path":"/guides/speaking/how-conferences-choose/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13idRXpK-5svs-Lp_c5-cYWFPKsahVyWU"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Hundreds of technology conferences take place around the world every year.

Breadth and Depth</h3>\n<p>If you’re in a narrow specialty, you may not have the opportunity to meet with many similar professionals in your city often. Some conferences cater to these narrow “niches” and go really deep into a single area of focus.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there are some tech conferences that cover a huge range of technologies and disciplines. These usually last longer and have multiple “tracks” so attendees can choose the talks they are most interested in.</p>\n<h3>2. Tracks</h3>\n<p>“Tracks” are the way most conferences divide up talks by specialty or area of interest. Some tech conferences may have a track for design, another for development, and a third for product managers. Usually, these individual tracks are capped off with one or two keynotes that have broad appeal to most attendees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Single-track conferences can be nice because you’re guaranteed the maximum audience size. However, it also means that there may be people in the audience who don’t care about your talk. With a multi-track conference, the people who do attend your talk will be more interested in what you have to say. But this also brings anxiety or disappointment when not as many people choose your talk as you’d like, and you have to give your talk to an awkwardly small crowd.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/4ho1VrO.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>3. Attendees</h3>\n<p>Some niche, regional conferences may attract fewer than 100 attendees. I’ve been to a couple where you didn’t really even need a microphone to reach the whole audience. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are some tech conferences with thousands of attendees who swarm on massive convention centers for days at a time.</p>\n<p>The smaller ones can be nice if you really want to form close relationships with a few people, but sometimes it’s nice to slip into anonymity at a huge conference and not have to see the same 5 people all the time.</p>\n<h3>4. Frequency</h3>\n<p>The majority of tech conferences happen annually, but there are some with bi-annual cadences. Usually, these will hold one event in America and the other in Europe to allow attendees on both hemispheres the opportunity to attend.</p>\n<h3>5. Location</h3>\n<p>Conferences don’t necessarily happen in big cities, but it is more common. If people are traveling to attend, it’s usually easier to host the event in a large, central location. That said, there are some conferences that happen in unique venues: a <a href=\"https://www.codercruise.com/\">cruise ship</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.atechconference.com/\">island</a>, or <a href=\"https://nomadphp.com/\">online</a>.</p>\n<h3>6. Corporate vs. Community-Run</h3>\n<p>A few large tech companies run their own conferences with the goal of promoting their technology and building a community of users. For example, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite\">Microsoft’s Ignite</a> and <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/\">Amazon’s re:Invent</a>. Just because these conferences have a clear agenda doesn’t mean the content isn’t valuable though. Many of us rely on keeping up with the latest technology that these companies release.</p>\n<p>Community-run conferences sit at the other end of the spectrum. These events are managed by fans or advocates for a particular language, technology, or project, and are often much lower-budget. Some rely on donations, some partner with sponsors, and others charge attendees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some conferences are for-profit. Others make little to no money for the organizers, and are largely a labor of love for the community. Some for-profit conferences will masquerade as the latter. Make sure you know what the conference is and if you’re comfortable with it before you accept.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Running a conference is notoriously challenging and expensive. Organizers have to coordinate a lot of details; pay for food, event space, speakers, and staff; find sponsors; sell tickets…the list goes on! If you’re interested in how this all shakes out, <a href=\"https://2019.jsconf.eu/news/the-jsconf-cssconf-eu-finances/\">JS Conf Europe’s organizers wrote an interesting overview of their finances last year</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Why Attend?</h2>\n<p>Plenty of experienced technology professionals never go to or speak at a conference. They can be expensive, take away time from focused work, and awkward - especially if you don’t know anyone there. That said, there are some great reasons to try attending a tech conference sometime:</p>\n<h3>1. Learn New Skills</h3>\n<p>The tools available to technology professionals is changing rapidly, and it can be hard to keep up. Newsletters, blogs, and local user groups are all a great place to turn, but so are conferences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conferences are a prime place for learning about new or obscure libraries and packages that you haven’t used before. If it’s been done before, then someone somewhere will eventually give a talk about it.\n<em><a href=\"https://opensource.com/life/16/2/attending-technical-conferences-whats-big-deal\">Deb Nicholson</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>2. Meet New People</h3>\n<p>While attending talks is an obvious way to learn new things at a conference, you may also pick up some new ideas from your fellow attendees. Meeting people at conferences is also a great way to find a job or look for job candidates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like meeting like-minded people with the profession in common…I like the positive energy conferences have and regardless of where you work or the number of years of experience one has all of the participants are there to learn and share the experience.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-geshan-manandhar/\">Geshan Manandhar</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Be Inspired</h3>\n<p>Great speakers can motivate you; ignite your passions; inspire you to do something you wouldn’t have. Not every tech conference has room for a ton of inspirational talks, but many conferences try to include some of these in their keynote slots.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYlT4lU5pb4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>“A Tinker Story” by dina Amin</em></p>\n<h3>4. Have Fun</h3>\n<p>Finally, attending a tech conference can be really fun. Last time I went to <a href=\"https://www.codemash.org/\">Codemash</a>, I got to visit the NASA facilities in Sandusky, Ohio, see the indoor water park, and play virtual reality video games in the arcade for hours after the talks ended.</p>\n<p>If you think attending a tech conference is a great experience, keep reading!

The great players in baseball only hit the ball 1/3 of the time at best. I find I only get accepted to every 1 out of 3 conferences I apply to. There’s a zillion reasons why your talk wasn’t accepted that has nothing to do with you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Too similar to another already accepted</li>\n<li>Too different to the other talks accepted</li>\n<li>Technical, and they needed more non-technical content</li>\n<li>Too advanced</li>\n<li>Too geared towards beginners</li>\n<li>All over the place</li>\n<li>Too specific</li>\n<li>Not the right fit for attendees</li>\n<li>Your talk isn’t unique (gave at other conferences)</li>\n<li>Your talk is too immature (haven’t given at any other conferences)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see from the above list of reasons that speakers can be rejected by a conference, there is almost no way to get every talk accepted, and it’s usually not a judgment on you, your ability, or even your qualifications. Conferences are just overwhelmed with submissions and have to draw the lines somewhere. Many times that means you won’t get chosen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of JSConfs receive an average of 500 proposals…\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>1. What you’ll hear when you’re rejected</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, many conferences don’t even notify speakers when they’re not chosen to speak. This means that you might not even know your talk was rejected until the conference releases its lineup. It’s frustrating, but a reality to get used to before you get into speaking.</p>\n<p>That said, it is really nice when the conference does take time to give you a rejection and feedback about why your talk wasn’t chosen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. I’m learning from each rejection I get.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-kara-luton/\">Kara Luton</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>2. You’re not alone</h3>\n<p>Once you realize you’re not going to be speaking at this particular conference, take heart! You’re not alone - most of the people who applied were not accepted. Even prolific speakers at tech conferences are rejected frequently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My CFP rejected-to-win ratio is probably around 0.00001 which is definitely an exercise in learning how to accept rejection and not take it personally.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-rizwan-javaid/\">Rizwan Javaid</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mk3Wkwq.jpg\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shouldn’t let the rejection emails get you down. I’ve spoken at conferences on three different continents, and I still regularly get rejected. Keep applying and refining your proposals.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It’s especially tough for new speakers though as this kind of rejection is probably not something you’re used to.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is usually difficult to get started as a conference speaker in terms of getting your CFP submissions accepted. This is totally okay and you don’t need to worry about it!\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/\">Jaime Lopez</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best thing you can do is learn from each rejection and try again. There’s no shortage of <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/conferences/\">technology conference CFPs</a> to apply for, so keep a positive attitude and keep trying.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s like for pull requests: just as you’re not your code, you’re not your submissions. Accept probabilities are not in your favor, and face rejection with the same maturity.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Improving for next time</h3>\n<p>Rejection is most helpful when it can be turned into a learning experience. If the conference doesn’t give you a reason for your talk not being selected, you can email the organizers and ask them for feedback:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some conferences are happy to provide feedback when your session isn’t selected. Ask for it. It doesn’t hurt, and if they have time, they may respond. Some won’t though as they are often dealing with hundreds of sessions.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to asking for feedback, you can do your own sleuthing to find out how you could improve your talk for next year:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look at the talks that were accepted, what did they have in common with your proposal? What did they have that was different? Maybe you can ask some of the people who got talks accepted to share their details &#x26; pitch (things that are not put on the schedule).\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, you might get a discount to attend the conference just because you submitted to. It might be worth going so you can meet some of the other speakers and organizers and learn what things will make your application stand out next year. Getting engaged with the speaker community is a great way to learn more about what makes a successful conference speaking proposal.</p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Getting Accepted</h2>\n<p>You will probably get more rejections than you do acceptances, but if you submit CFPs long enough, you’ll eventually get a talk accepted. Congratulations! Enjoy the moment. Once you’re ready to think about what comes next, there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>\n<h3>1. You should confirm or decline the invitation</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JaEn0YQ.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>Just because you filled out the application months ago doesn’t mean your schedule will still allow you to speak. Most conference organizers know this, so when they accept your application they’ll ask you to confirm or decline the invitation. If you’re a new speaker or you’re less picky about which speaking opportunities you take, you might start off by accepting all of them, but I’ve met a few popular speakers who have had to decline conflicting speaking opportunities.</p>\n<p>When you must decline a conference’s invitation, here are some tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be gracious but honest.</strong> You don’t want to burn bridges with the conference in case you have the opportunity to speak again next year.</li>\n<li><strong>Suggest another speaker if you can.</strong> Do you know someone else who might be able to speak about a similar topic? It never hurts to send a recommendation along with your response when you have to decline a speaking opportunity, plus it might give you the chance to help a new speaker get their start.</li>\n<li><strong>Offer to help promote the conference on your social media anyway.</strong> Once a conference picks its speakers, they need to start getting attendees. Anything you can do to help them sell tickets will help keep that relationship healthy in case you apply again next year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully, you won’t have to decline too many opportunities, but when it happens, don’t feel bad. Conference organizers know this happens and probably won’t hold any ill will towards you if you’re prompt in your response.</p>\n<h3>2. Note any logistical details they give you</h3>\n<p>If you can accept the invitation to speak, there’s a lot to figure out before the big day comes. How will you get to the conference? Will you need a flight? Bus? Train? How will you get from the airport to the hotel? How should you book your hotel room? Which meals will be provided? What time am I speaking? Who’s paying for all this?</p>\n<p>Hopefully, you worked out some of those details before you applied, but if not, you should definitely clear them up with the organizers as soon as possible. Experienced conference organizers know these things are on your mind and might give you a laundry list of expectations and a loose schedule, but if not you can certainly ask. Even if they don’t have the details ready yet, you can ask for a date to follow up with them and get them.</p>\n<p>Finally, know what your next steps are. Some conferences are very good about keeping in touch between the moment they accept you and the conference start date, but others go silent until a few days before. As long as you know what’s coming next, that’s fine, but make sure you’re clear on everything first.</p>\n<h3>3. Don’t let imposter syndrome or nerves get you down</h3>\n<p>Sometime between when you get accepted to speak at a conference and the moment you walk on stage, you may feel that you’ve made a huge mistake. About half of the conference speakers I’ve met have specifically mentioned feeling some degree of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90178296/5-steps-for-beating-impostor-syndrome-as-a-public-speaker\">imposter syndrome</a>, “the anxious feeling that, despite all your accomplishments, you aren’t actually very competent and everyone’s about to find out.”</p>\n<p>Here are just a few of the speakers I’ve interviewed who specifically mentioned feeling imposter syndrome and a little bit about how they cope with it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imposter syndrome is real and a totally normal feeling, so do not let that hold you back. Especially early on, I always had a feeling of “everyone in the audience will already know what I’m talking about.” That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/\">John Riviello</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jX78u78.jpg\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you’ve got friends in the audience — some you may know, and some you may not know…yet.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve always been extremely uncomfortable with my content not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I’ve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-tejas-kumar/\">Tejas Kumar</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Knowing that you’re not alone in feeling this way might help some, but the best way to overcome imposter syndrome is to <em>power through it</em>. The more you get on stage, the more comfortable you’ll be and the less inadequate you will feel about being there.</p>\n<h3>4. Keep your expectations in check</h3>\n<p>Finally, even after you’ve been offered a speaking slot and you’ve accepted, keep your expectations in check. In just two years of speaking, I’ve been invited to speak at one conference that was completely canceled, and one that bumped my 45-minute talk down to a 10-minute slot.</p>\n<p>My point is that nothing is certain, so don’t wrap too much of your self-worth up into your conference talks. These kinds of changes may be rare, but if you speak long enough, you’ll run into a last-minute change that throws a wrench in your conference plans.</p>\n<p>Now that you know what to expect upon being accepted to speak, it’s time to create your presentation! In the next section, we’ll look at several types of talk you can give and some tips for delivering your content from several great technology conference speakers.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../submitting/\">Previous: Submitting Abstracts</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../presentation/\">Next: Preparing a Presentation</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"What Comes Next?

Contact the Conference Directly</h3>\n<p>If you are focused on just a few specific conferences, you could reach out directly to each of them to express your interest in submitting. Many conferences start planning 6 months before the event, so they might be looking for CFPs early. That said, some organizers may not start working until 3 months before the event, or they might not have time to answer every email individually. In this case, you’ll end up spending a lot of time chasing them.</p>\n<p>In most cases, it’s unnecessary to ask a conference directly when their CFP will open as they’ll probably post something about it on their website. But, it’s worth mentioning because some conferences never hold an open CFP, so you have to reach out directly.</p>\n<h3>2. Subscribe to the Conference’s Website or Newsletter</h3>\n<p>Assuming the conference holds an open CFP, they’re likely to tell as many people as they can about it in their blog or newsletter. If you’re targeting a few specific conferences, this might be the best way to ensure you don’t miss their CFPs. Be careful counting on conference newsletters too much though. Some organizers are not very good at sending them, and they may forget to publicize their CFP that way.</p>\n<p>It will be annoying to check every conference website you’re interested in submitting to every few weeks, but it may be the only way to ensure you don’t miss a certain CFP.</p>\n<h3>3. Social Media</h3>\n<p>Twitter is probably the most popular social network for technology conferences and speakers, so you may want to start following people there. Following individual conferences will get you started, but there are a number of good accounts that tweet out about open CFPs. You can also save a few Twitter searches to accomplish this goal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">Tae’lur Alexis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Use a CFP Aggregator</h3>\n<p>I’m biased towards this one - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/how-cfpland-came-to-be/\">that’s why I started CFP Land</a> - but it’s also the most convenient method if you want to apply to speak at a lot of conferences. <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">Confs.tech</a>, and <a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">CallingAllPapers</a> are the most comprehensive CFP aggregators, but there are other niche topic aggregators as well. At CFP Land, we add the perks that speakers can expect from the conference, but you could also look that information up yourself on each conference’s website.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these aggregators have a list of open CFPs and some of them offer a newsletter or email alerts as well. The biggest downside to a CFP aggregator is that you’re bound to miss some conferences that they aren’t aware of. I’ve collected over 1200 conference CFPs in the past two years, but every month subscribers submit dozens of new ones that I didn’t know existed.</p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Never miss a speaking opportunity again.</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to the CFP Land newsletter to get new CFPs delivered to your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Deciding Which CFPs to Submit to</h2>\n<p>As you start learning more about the wide array of conferences out there, you’ll discover that there are likely more open CFPs than you have time to submit to. Every speaker must decide which conferences are worth their time, so while you may not be as picky when you’re just getting started, it’s certainly worth considering the following criteria with each CFP.</p>\n<h3>1. Topic Area</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/n827vdA.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>You don’t have to have a complete talk ready before you start submitting abstracts to open Calls for Proposals, but you should have some idea of what kind of topics you want to speak about. While conferences will usually look for a range of talks, you are never going to get a Ruby talk accepted to a Python conference. Plus, as Nick points out, that Python conference may not be interesting to you anyway:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Maybe you can get your talk on web accessibility accepted at DjangoCon, but if you aren’t interested in Python, then the rest of the conference will be of minimal value to you.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most conferences will provide information about the topics and kinds of talks they want on the CFP page, but if they don’t take a look at videos or listings of the previous year’s talks. This should give you some idea what they are looking for.</p>\n<h3>2. Location</h3>\n<p>One of the first conferences I spoke at was Codemash, and while I loved the event, traveling to Sandusky, Ohio in January is not always pleasant. As you look for conferences, you may want to prioritize those in locations that would be fun to visit or where you have friends or coworkers.</p>\n<p>I’ve actually spoken at some conferences that did not pay for my hotel because I had a friend in town I could stay with anyway. This makes it easier for the conference to support you financially, plus I got to hang out with an old college friend who lives on the other side of the country.</p>\n<h3>3. Financial Viability</h3>\n<p>Getting accepted to speak at a conference in Thailand may sound great, but if they don’t cover your flight costs, you might be paying several thousand dollars just to get there. Most conferences will list the speaker perks they offer on their website, but if not, you can email the organizers directly to ask. In my experience, about 30% of tech conferences cover travel and hotel costs for their speakers, and about 1% offer an extra stipend.</p>\n<p>Another way to fund your speaking excursion might be to turn to your employer. Some companies offer an education budget to employees and attending a conference - even as a speaker - is certainly an educational experience. You could also make the argument that you’ll help your employer raise awareness of their product or any open job listings while you’re there. It may or may not work, but it’s worth trying.</p>\n<p>Finally, many conferences offer other perks to speakers - whether they can cover travel or not. For example, I’ve seen conferences offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free speaker training sessions</li>\n<li>Airport transportation</li>\n<li>Speaker’s dinner</li>\n<li>Gift bags or cards for speakers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these add-ons may help make speaking more financially viable, but to be honest, most new speakers will not get paid much for their speaking directly.</p>\n<h3>4. Reputation</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not all conferences are born equal: whether you like it or not, there’s a “coolness” factor attached to each of them.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether you call it “coolness” or “reputation” or “prestige”, it’s true that not all conferences hold the same weight. Smaller, regional conferences are more like a big meetup, so speaking there may not be that difficult. On the other hand, some huge tech events are extremely competitive and aim to only accept world-class speakers. Either way, there’s no harm in applying to speak at a conference that you feel is “above your pay grade.” The only way to move up is to go for it!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I recommend looking at videos from prior years and looking at the conference website, to see if it appears to be the work of conscientious, detail-oriented, experienced people.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you may start by applying at smaller, newer conferences, it is a good idea to look into how the conference has been run in the past. Do they treat their speakers and attendees well? Are the organizers well-known? Do they have a good reputation? Ask around if you don’t know anyone who’s been to the event personally.</p>\n<p>Finally, consider whether or not you want to take a risk by speaking at a first time conference. I have had good and bad experiences with new events: one had to cancel the event due to lack of interest, and the other was an awesome conference run by very professional and experienced people. Talk to the organizers and do what you can to understand their vision for the event.</p>\n<h3>5. Commitment to Diversity</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5ezcedx.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, you should know whether the event has a commitment to diversity and will provide a welcoming environment for all attendees and speakers. You don’t want to be attached to an event that gets bad press for excluding people or allowing hostile behavior. Look for a code of conduct, ask the organizers about this, and take a look at their speaker lineup from previous years. I - like many speakers - believe that <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">conferences should choose speakers that reflect the diversity of the communities they hope to serve</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you start to find conferences that would be a good fit for you, it’s time to write and submit your first abstract.

Get permission from your employer</h3>\n<p>Not every employer is as generous about speaking. Some will make you take personal days when you go to a conference, and others will make you show your presentation to the PR or legal department first to ensure you aren’t saying anything untoward. On the other hand, some companies will be thrilled that you’re representing them as a speaker and giving them a little free visibility in the community.</p>\n<p>Either way, address it early and figure out what you need to do to get their compliance.</p>\n<h3>2. Double-check the dates with the organizers</h3>\n<p>Organizing a conference is hard work, and sometimes things have to change for unforeseen reasons. While rare, it’s possible that your session could be cut, the conference may have to change its start date or location, or it may get canceled entirely.</p>\n<p>Before you spend any money or take time off work, double-check with the organizers. They also may have a special process for you to go through in order to qualify for reimbursement.</p>\n<h3>3. Book flights and hotel rooms</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve touched base with the organizers, you can go ahead and book any flights or hotel rooms. If you haven’t already, now is the time to lock in who will be paying for the trip: the conference, your employer, or you personally.</p>\n<p>In my experience, less than half of the tech conferences listed on CFP Land cover travel and hotel costs for speakers (if you want to be sure they do, you can use the <a href=\"/conferences/\">filters on CFP Land</a> to check before you apply).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reach an agreement with the organizers on what level of reimbursement they’ll provide before you accept their offer. This is more important with international travel.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another common consideration is combining your conference talk with a personal vacation. For example, I’m speaking at a conference in Minneapolis this summer, but I’m going to bring my family along and stay a few extra days to see the city. If you’d like to do something similar, make sure you clear it with whoever is funding the trip, and try to schedule the vacation time <em>after</em> your talk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you’re going to combine the conference trip with vacation, I highly recommend doing the vacation after the conference, so you’re not stressed about your talk the whole time.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Gather necessary legal documentation</h3>\n<p>This only applies in certain circumstances, but it’s possible when speaking internationally that you’ll need a passport, tax documents, or even a visa. Talk to the organizers as they’ll likely be fielding similar questions from other speakers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2LscPp7.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>5. Get details on the speaker’s dinner</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I really enjoy all the people I’ve been able to meet as a result of the speaking that I’ve done. I especially enjoy chatting with people at the speaker dinners or other informal events surrounding the conference.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like Keanan, I’ve found speaker dinners to be one of the most valuable networking times at a conference. If the conference isn’t having one, ask the organizers if they are offering a Slack channel specifically for speakers or some other informal networking event for speakers. Take full advantage of these and plan to attend if at all possible.</p>\n<h3>6. Practice your presentation</h3>\n<p>While this is covered in more detail in the <a href=\"../presentation/\">section dedicated to creating your presentation</a>, it bears repeating. Plan time to practice your talk. You may make tweaks up until the week before, but at some point, you’ll have to lock it down and practice. Work out your timings, and make sure it fits within the time slot given.</p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>1-2 Weeks Before the Conference</h2>\n<h3>1. Read over the conference website and speaker materials</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most conference organizers will create a speaker brief or handbook to convey all the key information to you about the event. They’ll cover things like who the audience is, the overall event theme, and the agreed title and content of your talk.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By this time, it’s been months since you applied and accepted your invitation, so it will be helpful to reorient yourself to the conference. This also prevents you from asking the organizers any questions that are already answered elsewhere as they’re probably very busy making final preparations for the event.</p>\n<h3>2. Figure out “last mile” transportation</h3>\n<p>At this point, you should figure out how you’ll get from the airport or train station to your hotel, and finally to the event itself. Well-prepared organizers may sort this out for you and send you instructions (I even spoke at one conference that had limousines pick us up from the airport individually!), but if not, you should look into it. A cab may be expensive, so you might want to find public transportation options, or your hotel might offer shuttle pickup and dropoff.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the conference might not be in the same building as your hotel. If you have to commute, find out if other speakers or attendees are as well, and try to coordinate with them.</p>\n<h3>3. Review the conference schedule</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try to see as many other talks as I can, though that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You should figure out where your talk fits into the conference schedule, and make note of any other talks you’d like to attend. I started off looking for content that sounded interesting, but now I actually look for speakers who I think would be good to meet and talk with and focus on going to those talks instead.</p>\n<p>You should also be aware of the timing of your talk in the day, and the other sessions that are going on at the same time. I find audiences most attentive early on, so I work a little harder to make my talks interactive if they’re just before closing or right after lunch.</p>\n<h3>4. Do you look the part?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you take to the stage, your audience will examine every detail the way they examine a painting — as if it’s there to signify something. For better or worse, clothes serve as visual symbols, so it’s worth thinking about what your clothes are saying as the latest sentence in humanity’s very long visual conversation.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67\">Cassie Kozyrkov</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JQ0ZiSk.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>Speaking at tech conferences doesn’t mean you have to dress formally, but you should dress appropriately for the venue, audience, and content. At this point, you should make sure you’ve got a couple of good outfits to pick from and schedule a last-minute haircut (if needed).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you should be comfortable on stage, but that doesn’t just mean wearing a grey sweatsuit. “Comfortable” means wearing something that gives you confidence and reflects your personal brand.</p>\n<h3>5. Figure out what kind of equipment will be available</h3>\n<p>I talked more about <a href=\"../presentation/\">equipment preparation in the previous section</a>, but at this point, you should double-check with the organizers to see what is available. Will they have a microphone? What kind will it be? Will you be using your laptop or a shared one? Will your power cord work there? What adapters will be available?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Display is not the only point to take into account. If you’re traveling in other countries, power plugs need to be taken care of as well. European countries are mostly compatible with one another, but watch out if you come to Northern America or UK.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Will there be wifi on stage? How fast will it be? (always prepare for it to be slower than you think)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your presentation requires network access, it’s your responsibility to make sure the Wifi will be good enough on-site. For that, I usually ask if there will be a Wifi network dedicated for speakers: I don’t have confidence in a shared one.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You shouldn’t <em>have</em> to bring anything besides your laptop or presentation aids, but it’s worth asking just to be sure.</p>\n<h3>6. Mentally prepare, and keep practicing</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While some experienced speakers can deliver a high-quality presentation on the fly, most recommend practicing your talk. If you can give your talk to a real audience (like at a meetup or work event) you’ll feel more confident when the conference comes, but even just practicing alone in front of a mirror can help.</p>\n<h2>When You Arrive at the Conference</h2>\n<h3>1. Scout out your room</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You should also figure out what room you’ll be speaking in — are you in the keynote slot, or in a tiny side-room? Will your talk be recorded? Some conferences only record certain tracks.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As early as possible, you should take a look at the room you’ll be presenting in. By this point, the schedule should be finalized, so you will be able to see exactly when and where you’ll give your talk. I typically try to watch a couple talks in the room before my own so I know what it feels like as an audience member there as well.</p>\n<h3>2. Test out any media</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have any kind of interactivity or rich media in your presentation, you absolutely have to run through it with the organizer onsite before you go on stage.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you just need slides, this should be quick, but if you’re trying any video or live coding in your presentation, you really need to make sure the equipment available will work as soon as you arrive.</p>\n<p>Even if you asked before, there’s no substitute for knowing it works in person.</p>\n<h3>3. Follow the conference Twitter hashtag or Slack group</h3>\n<p>Finally, as you prepare to speak, it’s a good idea to plug into the audience’s conversation. Most conferences will provide an official “hashtag” on Twitter, but many also have Slack groups as well.</p>\n<p>After your presentation, you may want to check out the stream to see what the audience says about your talk.</p>\n<h2>The Hours Leading Up To Your Session</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won something: pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few “Hell yeah!“s if I think the toilet is empty…it calms my nerves enough so I don’t shake as I speak.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/\">Alex Lakatos</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every speaker’s pre-talk routine is different, but for many of them, having a consistent, confidence-boosting routine is helpful. There are a few things you can try as you develop a pre-talk routine:</p>\n<h3>1. Work out or walk around</h3>\n<p>I always work out or run on the morning of my conference talks. <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/how-working-out-makes-you-more-confident-from-the-inside-out-according-to-science-8565734\">Working out helps boost my confidence</a>, but even just walking around a little helps stimulate blood flow and make you feel better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7p8WBZD.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>2. Arrive early</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try to arrive in the room as early as I can after the previous speaker, and normally I run the talk through without notes while getting ready that morning.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laurie-barth/\">Laurie Barth</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Organizers appreciate it when you are in the room before your talk is scheduled to begin. Try to come in at least halfway through the previous speaker’s talk so you can get set up as soon as they’re finished.</p>\n<h3>3. Talk to people</h3>\n<p>For me, talking builds momentum. If I spend a few minutes on the day of my talk conversing with fellow attendees and speakers, I feel much better about getting on stage. I’m not sure if there’s any scientific basis for this, but it works for me.</p>\n<h3>4. Sit in a quiet room</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, I’ve met speakers who go into a dark, quiet room up until the moment they get on stage. There’s nothing wrong with this method either, so you’ll just have to figure out what works for you.</p>\n<h3>5. Listen to a pump-up playlist</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another common preparation technique is listening to music. Generally listening to upbeat music can make you feel more confident and care-free, so it makes sense that this appeals to many speakers.</p>\n<p>Going into a conference prepared is one of the best ways to ensure your success as a speaker. It’ll help you be more confident and organizers will appreciate you being proactive.</p>\n<p>If you’ve read through this entire guide, congratulations!

Your talk may not fit perfectly into any one of these archetypes, but it’s helpful to start off with one of these formats and then branch out as your talk matures.</p>\n<h3>1. A novel solution to a common problem</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a new framework becomes popular, there’s often a variety of opinions about the best way to do automated testing for code that uses it. Even if your solution isn’t the best, it can become a standard if you’re the first with a conference video.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the fun things about working in technology today is that there are always new and (arguably) better solutions coming out for various problems. Most new solutions are viable candidates for a conference talk, so this format is pretty common.</p>\n<p>While the specifics vary, a typical presentation of this format might start off by introducing a problem, then talk about existing solutions, and finally give the audience a new (and again arguably better) solution.</p>\n<p>In the talk below, Pete Hunt introduces React by walking through several of the problems that the framework aims to solve. While an introductory talk on React probably won’t get much interest at a conference now, in 2013 React was brand new, so this talk was very popular.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7cQ3mrcKaY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>React: Rethinking best practices by Pete Hunt</em></p>\n<h3>2. The hero’s journey</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They learn that hey, this is hard, and it’s ok to struggle. This person, who must be smart because they’re up there on the stage, makes mistakes. I make mistakes too, so we’re kind of similar. They conquered their problem, so maybe I can conquer mine.\n<em><a href=\"http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks\">Jeff Casimir</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A common pattern for storytelling is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey\">the hero’s journey</a>. You may not have heard this term, but you’ve definitely seen it played out in hundreds of movies, TV shows, and books. The way it works in a conference talk is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You introduce yourself in a happy initial state,</li>\n<li>Something happens that upsets your initial state,</li>\n<li>You reluctantly start a journey to resolve the conflict,</li>\n<li>You reach a low point when your initial assumption fails,</li>\n<li>And finally, you emerge victorious by solving the problem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are variations on this theme, but if your talk is meant to be more personal or story-driven, this is a good format to use.</p>\n<p>Hero’s Journey Illustration: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Bv2Quqe.png\">https://i.imgur.com/Bv2Quqe.png</a></p>\n<p>In the talk below, TJ VanToll walks the audience through his process of changing his mind about Typescript. Along the way, we learn about the language and why it’s ultimately superior in some cases.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6rdLx2LYz8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Why I Was Wrong About TypeScript by TJ VanToll</em></p>\n<h3>3. The tech-heavy deep dive</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These talks focus on something that’s cool but that not many engineers get to work with on a day to day basis.\n<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot of tech people like technical deep dives because they’re inspiring. Most of us don’t use all the cutting edge technology available day-to-day, so we appreciate hearing from those who do.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this structure of talk can show people how to use things better that they may already know at a surface level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of my favorite forms is the deep dive. This is what I might call the Pat Shaughnessy talk. It’s been a long time since I studied undergrad Computer Science, and I didn’t understand a lot of it the first time around.\n<em><a href=\"http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks\">Jeff Casimir</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here’s one of Pat Shaughnessy’s talks - a deep dive into ActiveRecord. While most Ruby on Rails developers at the conference have used ActiveRecord, most of them probably don’t know exactly how it works under the hood, so they get a lot of value out of learning these mysterious internals.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rnLnRPZZ1Q4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under ActiveRecord by Pat Shaughnessy</em></p>\n<h3>4. The live demo</h3>\n<p>Live demos are among the most impressive (when they work) and the most underwhelming (when they don’t) talks I’ve ever seen at a conference.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, live coding a working application and showing the audience the results is a great way to illustrate how easy a new framework or tool can be. It’s inspiring and impressive to watch, and you’ll get some big “oohs” and “ahhs” when it goes perfectly.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it rarely goes perfectly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Have backups. If your demo breaks on stage, revert to showing the video of the same thing in action.”\n<em><a href=\"https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp\">Tomasz Lakomy</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I saw one live coding talk where the presenter accidentally deleted his whole template and all his notes just minutes before the talk. He was so flustered that he had to bow out early and apologize for being ill-prepared. That’s probably the worst-case scenario.</p>\n<p>If you do choose to attempt a live demo have a robust backup plan, practice a ton, and make sure you can test it out on the same equipment you’ll use for the actual presentation.</p>\n<p>In this example, Andrew Sorensen live codes a concert for his audience. While he’s working, he explains what’s happening and never drops a note. Best of all, he keeps the whole show to a tight 10-minute time slot. This is really impressive, and I can’t imagine how much preparation has gone into it.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yY1FSsUV-8c' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>The Concert Programmer by Andrew Sorensen</em></p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Conference Presentation Tools</h2>\n<p>Once you land on a format for your talk, you’ll need to decide which tools you want to use to give the presentation. I’d recommend using the tools you’re most familiar with until you get really comfortable speaking on stage. Once you’ve done this a few times, you can try to get creative, but don’t buck the system your first time.</p>\n<h3>1. Slides</h3>\n<p>Most talks center around a slideshow. PowerPoint and Google Slides are probably the most common options, but <a href=\"https://prezi.com/\">Prezi</a> and <a href=\"https://revealjs.com/#/\">Reveal</a> are also good choices. Again, start with the tools you’re most comfortable with and experiment later.</p>\n<h3>2. Audio-Visual Aids</h3>\n<p>Some speakers like to show short video clips during their presentation. If you do this, be very certain you know the audio will work once it’s up on the big screen. There’s nothing worse than trying to put the microphone near your tiny laptop speakers to amplify the sound.</p>\n<h3>3. Microphone</h3>\n<p>Generally, the conference will provide a microphone if it’s necessary, but I’ve met a few speakers who bring their own because they want to be sure it’s a device they’re used to. The downside to this is that you’ll have to coordinate with the conference’s AV team, and some conferences may not make special accommodations like this.</p>\n<h3>4. Remote</h3>\n<p>I like to walk around while I’m on stage, so when possible, I bring a remote to advance my slides. You can get one for cheap online, or you could try to use a wireless mouse in a pinch. Most conferences don’t provide this for you.</p>\n<h3>5. Laptop</h3>\n<p>Finally, you’ll likely need a device to present from. While occasionally conferences will provide one, most prefer you connect your own before you speak. Be sure your battery will last for the duration of your talk and don’t count on a charger being available.</p>\n<p>I mention all these accessories here because you probably want to practice with the same devices you use for the real thing.</p>\n<h2>Building Your Presentation</h2>\n<p>Much of the same advice that applies when <a href=\"../submitting/\">writing your abstract</a> also applies when creating your presentation, but I’d like to point out a few key tips for creating your slide deck and delivering your presentation.</p>\n<h3>1. Mix stories and information</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stories, metaphors, examples, jokes, pictures, videos and other props are all excellent ways to keep things interesting, but make sure that they clearly relate to your core takeaways.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No matter what format you use for your presentation, the best ones are a mix of stories and factual guidance or information. The most common weakness that technology speakers present is not including any interesting anecdotes to help capture their audience’s attention.</p>\n<p>Every speaker and talk is different, but as you build your presentation, make sure that you’re weaving in stories that illustrate your points.</p>\n<h3>2. Use slides for illustrations</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People can only process one inbound message at a time. They will either listen to you or read your slides; they cannot do both.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.duarte.com/wean-yourself-from-presentation-slides/\">Mark Duarte</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another common mistake speakers make is to fill every slide with bullet points. Because your audience can only listen <em>or</em> read, you should be very careful with the amount of text you cram into a slide.</p>\n<p>This can be a hard habit to break, but it might help to set up speaker notes so that you can look at your bullet points while your audience can actually listen to you or look at an image that frames your topic on the screen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your slides only really serve three good purposes: entertainment, illustration, and roadmap. Anything else is distracting your audience from listening to you.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67\">Cassie Kozyrkov</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. First and last slides</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I always set the conference logo on the cover slide. The people behind the conference have put a lot of effort into the organization, it’s only fair play to promote their brand by doing so. Plus, they generally provide logos, so it’s a no-brainer.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your cover slide will spend a little time on screen while you get set up and your audience gets settled. For that reason, you should probably include the title of your talk (that way people will know they’re in the right place), your name, and the name or logo of the conference you’re speaking at. If the talk is being recorded this is especially important as it will serve to introduce future online viewers as well.</p>\n<p>Your last slide should probably include contact information (if you want to provide it) and a link to your slides or notes so that anyone who wants more detail can go find it. This last slide will probably be up for Q&#x26;A and until the next speaker is ready to take the stage.</p>\n<h3>4. Humor</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep politics and religion out of your sessions. Also, avoid sexualized imagery, and try not to be an asshole about other people to make a point.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Uk7Zl4m.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>While you want to be an entertaining speaker, you were not invited to this conference as a standup comedian. Making a programming joke or two during a technical talk is probably okay, but anything that could be considered “dark”, “edgy”, or “controversial” should probably not be included.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure, practice your jokes with a trusted friend or colleague first. Everyone likes a funny speaker, but you don’t want to be remembered as the speaker who offended half the room by going too far.</p>\n<h3>5. Practice</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stand up and practice out loud. If you screw something up, do not stop. You won’t get to repeat the whole talk on stage so having those prep sessions at home will make you well prepared for any mishap that might happen on stage.\n<em><a href=\"https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp\">Tomasz Łakomy</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve met a few speakers who know their subject matter so well that they don’t really practice anymore, but this is rare. Almost all of the best speakers I’ve talked with practice a lot, especially with a new talk. I typically run through my talk at least 25 times before I give it on stage at a conference.</p>\n<p>At the same time, you don’t want to sound robotic, so don’t memorize a speech word-for-word. Instead, work of bullet points or notes to give you a good idea of which stories and information come at what times. The only things you might want to rehearse to the point of memorization are your opening line, your closing line, and key transition points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Local user group meetups are always looking for speakers so if you approach them you will rarely hear a, ‘no.’\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-geshan-manandhar/\">Geshan Manandhar</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Practicing alone in front of a mirror is step 1, but most speakers recommend also getting some practice in front of a real group of people. Invite a few of your coworkers to a lunch-and-learn or submit your talk to a Meetup group. As the organizer of a Meetup in Chicago, I can tell you that we always like getting talks submitted by the community.</p>\n<h3>6. Smile and look like you’re having fun</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Enjoy being on the stage and sharing your learnings and experience. Smile! Tell a joke. Be human, and you’ll notice the audience respond to you.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, as you practice the transitions and mechanics of your talk, remember to smile and convey enthusiasm. Even if you’re actually a nervous wreck underneath, people in the audience can rarely tell if you put on a brave face. Faking enthusiasm and calm usually helps keep you that way, so it’s okay if this doesn’t feel natural at first.</p>\n<p>Creating a presentation for a conference talk is a never-ending job. You’ll probably refine your talks each time you give them, customize them based on the time slot and audience, and learn new things to add every year. As you do, keep in mind the presentation tips above.</p>\n<p>Now that you’ve started preparing your presentation, it’s time to get ready for the conference itself. In the next section, we’ll talk about the pre-conference and pre-talk logistics and best practices you should know about as a new speaker.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../success-rejection/\">Previous: Dealing with Success or Rejection</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../pre-conference/\">Next: Preparing for the Conference</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Preparing a Conference Presentation","path":"/guides/speaking/presentation/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11nJ2Hnc3CkmrU97ZV83nP0SB0EV80s_K"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>If you’re considering submitting a conference talk, but you’re not sure if it’s worth it, read on.

Developer Advocates: Professional Technical Speakers</h2>\n<p>I didn’t realize this was a job until I started speaking at conferences and met a few people who did this. “Developer Advocates” (sometimes called DevRels or Developer Evangelists) are paid to get their company’s name out into the public. It’s a lot like marketing, but with a decidedly technical bent.</p>\n<p>Most Developer Advocates still write code, help support the products they work on and are involved in coming up with and testing new features. Because their job is to be in the public eye, many of them are very prolific speakers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During my first year [in Developer Relations] at Okta…I spoke 37 times, at 20 conferences, in 10 different countries.\n<em><a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/01/28/developer-relations-pro-tips\">Matt Raible</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While an element of their job may require speaking, many also do it for other reasons you’ll read about below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eHIEzXQ.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>2. Promote a Business or Project</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a good way to boost my career prospects as a technology consultant.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jason-swett/\">Jason Swett</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Small business owners and consultants are always looking for an edge, and for many getting recognition by speaking at conferences is a great opportunity. Not only do they get to make a name for themselves, but they may also meet people in the audience who actually want to hire them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the connections I’ve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs and new clients.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some developers also use speaking as an excuse to plug open source products they want to support.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try to contribute to some [open source] libraries also, but promoting them on stage feels like the best thing that I’m capable of doing. If something makes my life better, and some people invest their efforts and share it for free — I want to help them to gain exposure.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd\">Oleksandr Tryshchenko</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>3. Help Others</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I’m providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the most common answers I hear from people about why they got into public speaking is their desire to help others. Speaking is rarely a financially lucrative gig, so it’s a good thing that people find fulfillment just by spreading their knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try as much as possible to help other people get into tech, or get better at tech. Knowing I helped at least one person by being on stage and sharing my knowledge makes me feel a bit better about that.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/\">Alex Lakatos</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if a topic has been spoken about before, there are always new people coming into the industry who need to learn about it. Many speakers realize that their unique spin on something might shed new light on it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I’m talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn’t before.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-kara-luton/\">Kara Luton</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there are plenty of other ways to help others out, it is nice to be able to do it en masse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I enjoy being able to share my advice with a lot of people at once. It is like mentoring or giving advice on steroids.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-molly-struve/\">Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>4. Meet People</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s great to be able to speak about the thing you’re interested in in front of a lot of people, because it means for the rest of the conference the other people who share your passion will come up and talk to you.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/\">Nicola Rushton</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I never really started meeting people at conferences until I started speaking at them. Like many software engineers, I get intimidated by large groups of new people, but after speaking, attendees would come up to me and introduce themselves. It took a ton of the pressure off of meeting new people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think it’s a lot easier to meet people when you’re the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Local meetups are great for seeing friends and meeting people too, but at a conference, you can meet people from around the world. There’s nothing like it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things — not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you do start speaking at conferences, don’t miss out on the chance to meet new people. Even if it’s just a few of the other speakers, take advantage of the connections you can make at conferences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Too many speakers finish their talk and then rush off to catch a plane, or hole themselves up in a hotel room to get back on top of email. If you do this, you’re missing out on one of the most valuable aspects of an event: the networking.”\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>5. Recognition</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/\">Gant Laborde</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of the most active tech conference speakers have built up quite a following. I’m not one of them, but I have had a couple of talks where people came up to me later in the conference and said they enjoyed my presentation. I’ve even gotten a few Twitter followers as a result.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Some people have a bunch of Twitter followers and YouTube views, and this seems to make them happy. Building your public brand by speaking at conferences can be a way to work towards this.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, if fame and recognition is your #1 goal, be careful. Some conferences <a href=\"/guides/speaking/how-conferences-choose/\">prefer not to invite the most egotistical speakers</a>.</p>\n<h2>6. Travel</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’ve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places – I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZeztrR6.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>If you’re new to speaking at conferences, you might not realize this, but many speakers’ airfare and hotel stays are paid for by the event. I’ve worked with organizers to delay my return date by a day or two (with me picking up the extra hotel nights) so I could visit the city on my own time. This opportunity for free or low-cost travel is a great perk.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not every conference can afford to pay for every speaker to travel, so you’ll have to be picky if this is something you want. All the conferences listed on CFP Land include details about the perks included for speakers, so be sure to <a href=\"/conferences\">check out our list of CFPs</a>.</p>\n<h2>7. Personal Growth</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The more I present the more confident I become in my abilities to do so. This has helped with my social anxiety and with my ability to interact with clients or potential clients.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many software engineers and technology professionals don’t have to interact with customers or lead meetings on a daily basis. This lack of practice speaking in public makes it scary, but many people use conference speaking as a way to overcome this fear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don’t know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-rizwan-javaid/\">Rizwan Javaid</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Others I have talked to cite specific professional opportunities they’ve encountered because of their public speaking efforts. I’ve known several speakers who turned conference talks into books, online courses, or training workshops.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was given the opportunity to create a course for Lynda.com because I met Lynda.com staff author Ray Villalobos after we both spoke at a conference. It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/\">John Riviello</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/community/experts\">Google Developer Expert program</a> lists “Being an influential and recognized speaker,” as one of its criteria.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>8. Finding a Job</h2>\n<p>In addition to improving your presentation skills and gaining accolades in your field, speaking may even help land you a job. A couple of speakers I know have met people at their future employer at conferences as a result of their talks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During job interviews, I’ve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Making your resume stand out of the hundreds of others like it is tough; having some unique experience like speaking at a conference can really help set you apart.</p>\n<h2>9. The Rush</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects!\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-nicolas-frankel/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every time I complete a conference talk, I have a natural high that lasts for a good 2-3 hours. Maybe it’s just the tail end of my nervousness, but speaking can be invigorating.</p>\n<p>Not everyone reacts the same way though. I’ve met speakers who feel the need to run back to their hotel room and sleep after a talk. If you’re more introverted or anxious, the experience of speaking at a conference might just have the opposite effect.</p>\n<h2>10. Advocate a Cause</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity’s ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While tech conferences may remain <em>mostly</em> a-political, there are plenty of places where technology and social good intersect. Some speakers specialize in this arena.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aslvVbP.jpg\"></p>\n<p>For example, Eva PenzyMoog travels around the United States to give her talk about how technology enables certain kinds of domestic abuse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/\">Eva PenzyMoog</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want to make a positive impact on the world, speaking at conferences just might be your outlet.</p>\n<h2>11. Learn New Things</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Speaking is] an excuse to learn and play with new technology…Because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn’t touch at work.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A couple of years ago, I decided I wanted to learn Docker. I didn’t have much of a case for using it at work, but it seemed like promising technology that would be interesting to learn.</p>\n<p>I dove in headfirst - I started a couple of side projects that used it, wrote <a href=\"https://www.shiphp.com/\">a short book about it</a>, and started pitching talks about it to conferences. This year, I designed a four-hour workshop as well. I’ve found lots of other speakers also use their talks as an opportunity to learn something new.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I submit a talk proposal it’s usually on a topic that I am not an expert on, but one that I am interested in learning more about. I then have a motivator to deep dive into the topic to learn about it.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many conference talks include live coding or demonstrations, which are also a good excuse to play with new technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Building demos can really help you with learning the ins and outs on a topic and you never know what you may uncover.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">Tae’lur Alexis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s even research that indicates that <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-01-24-want-students-to-remember-what-they-learn-have-them-teach-it\">teaching a subject is one of the best ways to learn it</a>. If you have to break things down to a point where someone at any experience level can digest it, you’re going to have to understand the concept pretty well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While writing talks are a huge time commitment, there is nothing quite like explaining a concept to others to help crystalize it in your mind.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laurie-barth/\">Laurie Barth</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully, the reasons above have convinced you that speaking at conferences is a worthwhile endeavor. Next, we’ll dive into how conferences choose speakers and learn about the “Call for Proposals” process.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../introduction\">Previous: An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../how-conferences-choose/\">Next: How Conferences Choose Their Speakers</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Why Speak? 11 Reasons People Get on Stage","path":"/guides/speaking/why-speak/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ULa0I4_bXG3XJnXas6PaFhcuy1T6ujLa"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Writing and submitting an abstract for a conference CFP (Call for Proposals) is a skill just like actually getting up on stage to speak is a skill.

Be sure your topic is something you really want to speak, answer questions, and learn everything you possibly can about.</p>\n<p>Here are some things to consider when choosing a topic:</p>\n<h3>1. Does it fit the conference?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think carefully about what your audience is interested in as opposed to what you are. What problems do they want to solve? What are the gaps in their experience? Where do they need guidance? You need to serve a need and purpose, and if you can map your presentation more commonly to these needs, you are more likely to get picked.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Matching your talk with the conference’s area of focus is one of the best ways to get more talks accepted. Not only should the talk fit the conference’s broad area, but you should also look at the individual “tracks” the conference will be offering and make sure your abstract fits into one of them.</p>\n<p>For example, you’re never going to get a PHP-focused talk accepted at a Python conference, but if you have a Javascript talk, you might find lots of conferences with a “frontend” track that is appropriate for your topic.</p>\n<h3>2. Does it get you excited?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DO NOT propose a topic that you think will get you on stage but doesn’t actually excite you at all.\n<em><a href=\"https://rckbt.me/2014/01/conference-proposals/\">Raquel Vélez</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the hardest things you will ever have to do as a speaker is stand up on stage for an hour talking about something you’re not really interested in. That’s why you need to pick a topic that gets you excited, but keep in mind that your interests will change over time. Sometimes a topic you cared about 2 years ago will no stop be interesting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pick a topic that you wouldn’t mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your interest level and passion for the topic will come across in your presentation. It’s really hard to fake genuine excitement, and having that positive energy will make you a much more confident and effective speaker. Audiences want to listen to speakers who are excited about their topic, and conference committees will notice that in your application.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present. It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-drishti-jain/\">Drishti Jain</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, talks that get you excited are easy to prepare for. You probably choose to spend time learning about the topic already, so channeling that knowledge into a talk you can share with others is just the logical next step.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You know you’re passionate about a topic if you’re already spending a lot of time reading about it, thinking about it, and debating it with people on Twitter. Wrap your talks around your passions.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Is it something you know well?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgeable about. Don’t experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just being excited about a topic isn’t enough on its own. You also have to be (or become) very knowledgeable about it. While you may have lots of time to learn about the topic between when your talk gets accepted and when you first present it, don’t underestimate the amount of time it takes to prepare a really strong conference presentation.</p>\n<p>New speakers may want to stick to topic areas they know already to minimize the amount of after-hours work they have to put in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think of something you’ve been successful at professionally, and then think of what advice you’d give to others on that topic. Can you come up with 5–10 tips to make your audience better at X? A coding language, a new tool, even a soft skill? Then you’ve got enough to respond to a CFP.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/\">Laura Janusek</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using things you’ve learned at work or on a side project are usually a good direction. If you collaborated with others, you can also get their thoughts on the topic and integrate that into your talk as well.</p>\n<h3>4. Is it sufficiently unique?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talks that can be summarized as an ‘Intro to (Tool)’ are often lazily conceived, poorly designed, and delivered mechanically. Great talks, meanwhile, dive deeper and are eager to explore fundamental issues, even if they use a tool as the catalyst for discussion.\n<em><a href=\"http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks\">Justin Searls</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best conferences are looking for speakers who can do really unique and deep dives into a topic. Surface-level “intro to X” talks aren’t likely to get accepted at the most competitive international events. Speakers are expected to present unique, novel, experimental, and personal talks at these kinds of events.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s fairly easy for anyone to step in, read available materials and prepare a mediocre presentation. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve done it too, which now makes me able to see why we can do better. Trust me, we’ve all seen the Angular 2 talks already. Don’t copy your predecessors. Interesting angle on React Native? Experimental usage of Rails to build a realtime app? Your own personal experiences and unexpected solutions? Yes, please.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, smaller regional conferences might be interested in simple, “how-to” talks. Some of my most highly accepted talks are introductory-level talks on Docker and Testing because lots of attendees are actually interested in learning about those topics, and can use them as a reason to get their companies to send them to the conference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ANY topic is fair game even if people have talked about it before. You can always bring a new perspective to a topic.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-molly-struve/\">Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you should try to make your talk unique, you don’t <em>have</em> to be the only person in the world giving talks on a particular topic to get accepted to speak about it.</p>\n<h3>5. Does it make the world a better place?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that <a href=\"../why-speak/\">motivates many speakers</a> is a desire to improve the world around them, and this comes across in their choice of topics. Even technical topics can make the world a better place because they’re spreading knowledge that you have to others.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talk about topics that make the world a better place; in particular accessibility, diversity, ethics, etc. I [try] to go beyond just technical issues and spread good ideas I believe in.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd\">Oleksandr Tryshchenko</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Try to think about how your talk will improve the audience members’ lives. If you can convey that in the talk description or abstract, you’ll make a big impression on the organizing committee.</p>\n<h3>6. Is it genuine?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Submit sessions that are interesting, engaging, and challenging, but don’t resort to clickbait titles and topics. Break the mold of what people normally talk about and how they discuss it, but stay classy.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some speakers are tempted to take speaking as an opportunity to push the limits of what can be said on stage. This might work, but it’s a risky tactic for a new conference speaker. Selection committees can see through cheap laughs and hackneyed titles, so keep your topics clear and intentions genuine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The talks that are most engaging to me include stories of failure, they talk about learning something you don’t know and falling down along the way, or they’re a new perspective from an outsider on a specific topic.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laurie-barth/\">Laurie Barth</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being genuine can also mean sharing a story about how you failed in the past. This is a great topic because nobody succeeds every time they attempt something, so your audience will probably resonate with the description of challenges you’ve failed to reach.</p>\n<h3>7. Is it actionable?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talking about why technology X is cool in a general way can be just fine, but sharing how we used X at Y to achieve Z gives the audience something more concrete to walk away with.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thinking about topics that are actually useful to your audience is surprisingly hard. A lot of new technology is interesting but practically useless, so try to center around real problems that can be solved by your area of focus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OK talks are about the topic. Good talks are about the speaker/presentation. Great talks are about the audience.\n<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344\">Kyle Simpson</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another way of thinking about this is by thinking about your audience and what they hope to take away from your talk. Keeping your takeaways succinct and clear will help you in this effort. Your slides shouldn’t be bullet points, but there’s no reason your abstract shouldn’t use a list of key learnings for readers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your talk should have a point. When someone walks away from your talk they might only take away 2-3 things with them. Those things should be in your proposal\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Writing a Title and Abstract</h2>\n<p>Now that you have some tips for picking a topic, you can write a talk title and abstract. Each CFP you submit to will require a title and abstract and the organizing committee’s selection will be largely based on these fields, so it’s important to spend time on them.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips for writing a great abstract and title to submit to conference calls for proposals:</p>\n<h3>1. Customize each submission</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At least 30% of ~2,500 proposals I’ve ever read violated the predefined rules for talk abstracts and submissions that have been set…no matter how adept in speaking you are, do read the instructions carefully before submitting and ensure the proposal is following them.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every conference has its own set of priorities, rules, and requests for abstracts. Be sure to read everything they include on their CFP page as well as their conference website.</p>\n<p>In addition to the clearly-stated rules, every conference attracts a slightly different audience, and as a speaker, you should know who is in that audience before you submit your abstract. Even if the bulk of your talk will be the same at each conference, the abstract may need to be revisited between each one.</p>\n<h3>2. Include enticing details</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make it easy for a reviewer to get excited about your talk. Be specific and get into the details about what you’re point of view is.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260\">Maggi Mitchell</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vague abstracts or titles are not easy to assess. Conference attendees won’t go to a talk they don’t understand, so it’s best to be clear and include an appropriate amount of detail in each abstract you submit. This means including tangible details that show the organizers and attendees that you know what you’re talking about as well as some concrete takeaways they can expect to glean from your talk.</p>\n<h3>3. Don’t be too wordy</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of JSConfs receive an average of 500 proposals, assuming a very strict 1-minute reading time per submission it’s still a full workday of reading…A good rule of thumb is two to three paragraphs clearly expressing your idea.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Depending on the rules the conference lays out, between 200 and 500 words is usually allowed, so you have to include details while being succinct. It’s not easy, but when you consider that some conferences receive hundreds of submissions, it’s easy to see why it’s necessary.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that your audience might be reading your abstract on a small, printed handout, so be informative without boring them with jargon or unnecessary detail.</p>\n<h3>4. Get a proofreader</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A typical conference selection team will be reading dozens or hundreds of session proposals…That means conference organizers are going to skim…many if not most will automatically discount anything with obvious typographical and grammar mistakes.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">Larry Garfield</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of your abstract like you would your resume when applying for jobs. Details matter. Spelling and grammar mistakes will hurt your credibility and make you look sloppy to organizers who are already looking for any excuse to lighten their submission load.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jM4NxQD.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This reason alone is probably enough to get a proofreader, but having other people read your proposal can also help make sure you aren’t relying too heavily on jargon or assuming too much about what your reader knows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts — I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stepping back and being your own proofreader can help as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don’t immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An English teacher once told me to go back and read my papers one word at a time starting at the end. This forces you to think about each word and can help you fix simple spelling mistakes. Tools like Grammarly can help with these fundamentals as well.</p>\n<h3>5. Avoid cliches</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don’t use cliches, everyone uses cliches and it makes your proposal blend in. If you feel the pull of using a phrase everyone has heard “a million times”, ask yourself if it adds to what you’re trying to convey.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cliches are very tricky to use well without seeming trite. In general, conference speakers should avoid using them in their titles or abstracts. If you need some good examples of cliches, <a href=\"https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-cliches.html\">here’s a list</a>.</p>\n<h3>6. Find a format that works for your talk</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There’s no one right way to write a session pitch, but I’ve found the 3-part pitch works well for me. A 3-part pitch has three key points, in order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>State the problem</li>\n<li>Tease the solution</li>\n<li>Explain how you’ll provide the rest of the solution in the session</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">Larry Garfield</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not every speaker takes an approach that’s as prescribed as Larry’s above, but it might be a good idea to start with a very formulaic method of writing and submitting talks until you get more comfortable with the process. This can help you focus on the content and mechanics before moving on to creative approaches.</p>\n<h3>7. Get creative</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conferences are generally looking for novelty when choosing talks.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260\">Maggi Mitchell</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because you’re trying to stand out, there is some room to break the mold. While having a format for your talk submission might help, don’t feel like you can’t try something a little different from time to time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing I found helps in my abstract creative process, is to make word clouds. Given a topic like “security” or “performance” I write down as many other words come to mind. I then stack rank them based on which are the most interesting. I write about 10-20 different intro sentences. About 3-4 different copies of the “takeaway” sentences, and about 5-10 outro sentences. I then mix them up until they feel right.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Look into <a href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/articles/top-brainstorming-techniques--cms-27181\">brainstorming methods</a> if you have trouble coming up with creative new ideas or topics. Sometimes these will unlock things that will set your talk apart from other similar submissions.</p>\n<h3>8. Aim for a specific experience level</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn the approximate proficiency of your target audience before giving a talk. Make it easier or harder if needed. I mismatched several times, and it’s not the best thing to do.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd\">Oleksandr Tryshchenko</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Generally, conferences are looking for a wide range of talks directed at different experience levels. When you write your abstract, be sure to make it clear if your talk is especially directed at beginners, intermediate, or advanced learners. This will help the conference organizers know where to slot your talk in and help attendees decide whether your talk is right for them or not.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a conference was only filled with super-advanced talks, they would lose a huge part of their audience. So, even if you just learned something, you can teach it and many attendees will welcome your perspective as a relatively-recent beginner. Since you just went through it all for the first time yourself, you know and remember all the roadblocks that someone getting started will have and can help them learn even quicker.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>9. Use inclusive, positive language</h3>\n<p>Technology conferences have become <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">very aware of the lack of diversity and inclusion</a> in our industry, and many are actively trying to reverse it. Even if the conference isn’t addressing these issues directly, using words and phrases that may offend in your abstract is a really bad idea. It alienates users from your otherwise good content and makes you seem less credible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conference track chair here: please don’t curse or use any offensive language in your session title. It’s not cute, it violates the code of conduct, you were told not to in the CFP, and I will automatically rate your submission a zero.\n<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aburke626/status/1205566597563404288\">Alanna Burke</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, be aware of ableist language. You might think using the word “crazy” is just a way to describe illogical technology choices, but you could also be hurting people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Common examples of ableist language are words like, “lame,” “dumb,” “retarded,” “blind,” “deaf,” “idiot,” “imbecile,’ “nuts,” “psycho,” and “spaz.” These terms can be associated with a person’s identity or their challenges, and because of that, can be interpreted as insulting or hurtful.\n<em><a href=\"https://deareverybody.hollandbloorview.ca/learn/tips-and-tools/how-to-avoid-using-ableist-language/#.XcXTqJJKigQ\">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>10. Take time with the title</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A good title is reasonably short, self-descriptive, contains the appropriate buzzwords for your topic (and no others), and has enough of a “hook” to make someone want to read further (or attend).\n<em><a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">Larry Garfield</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While your abstract may be a few hundred words, your title will probably only be 10 or 20, so it’s really hard to make it convey meaning while being interesting to readers. This is why you should spend a good amount of time thinking about and refining your title.</p>\n<p>This is another area where brainstorming techniques and coming back to it later can help.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Set a timer for 3 minutes, write as many titles as you can. Pick your favorite, then write the rest of your submission. When you’re done go back and throw away the title and re-write it.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>11. Close strong</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make the last sentence in your abstract somewhat memorable, preferably short, even better if it’s actionable.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last sentence in your abstract is your hook. It’s that final word that reels readers in and makes them want more or inspires them. It matters.</p>\n<h2>Submitting Your Talks</h2>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rtdrFXw.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>Once you’ve picked a topic and written an abstract and title for your talk, you’re about almost done, but there are a few more things you should consider before you click the final “Submit” button:</p>\n<h3>1. You may be asked to submit more information</h3>\n<p>The organizing committee will select talks based primarily on the abstract and title fields, but they may also have you submit other information like a long description or your qualifications. These fields vary pretty widely, but since the audience is only internal conference organizers, you don’t have to worry quite as much about it being catchy. Shoot for informative, include lots of links to references, and videos of you speaking if possible. Conference organizers want to know that you can stand in front of a crowd.</p>\n<h3>2. Plan to submit multiple talks to each conference</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter how confident you are, never bet the farm on one idea — brainstorm and prepare several talks.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most conferences will encourage you to submit more than one talk, and some may have an upper limit on the number of talks you can submit. Either way, it will not hurt you to submit multiple abstracts. In fact, many conferences want speakers who can give multiple talks because it cuts down on the amount of funding and coordination they have to spend working with speakers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing that started really getting me more speaking opportunities is submitting multiple talks to each CFP. Conference organizers sometimes have an agenda of the talks they’re looking to accept and if you submit more talks, you give them more chances to fit you into the schedule they’re looking to craft.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Consider a workshop</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Workshops require a lot of preparation time that not every speaker has. You can improve your chances of being accepted by submitting such a workshop.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Conferences that offer workshops often struggle to find good speakers to give these 4-8 hour interactive sessions. You might be more likely to get your talk accepted if you offer it as a workshop. Keep in mind that workshops are completely different from typical conference talks though. The first time I gave a conference workshop, it took me about 20 hours of work to convert my slides into an interactive format for attendees.</p>\n<h3>4. Be persistent</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If getting a talk proposal accepted seems like an unattainable goal, just keep sending in proposals and you’ll probably eventually get something accepted.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jason-swett/\">Jason Swett</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the next section, we’ll talk more about dealing with success and rejection, but ultimately you have to be persistent if you want to become a conference speaker. Most speakers I talk to have an acceptance rate of around 10%-20%, so expect to submit at least 5-10 before you get a talk accepted.</p>\n<p>Keep trying, and if you’re ready to learn more, keep reading to learn what happens when your talk is accepted or rejected from a conference.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../finding-cfps/\">Previous: Finding and Selecting CFPs</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../success-rejection/\">Next: What Comes Next?

There’s something unifying about knowing that technologists from every corner of the globe can meet together to offer their tips and thoughts to others, and Vincenzo mentioned a similar appreciation in his interview here. As a speaker, he’s gotten to travel across the world to give talks on a variety of topics. Vincenzo’s approach to coming up with new talk ideas is also really interesting.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/G2DRaCN.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Vincenzo Chianese, I am an Italian Software Developer that’s been working for the last 5 years in the WebAPIs space, providing tools for API Developers. I mostly code in TypeScript/JavaScript these days, but previously I’ve worked with C#, C++ and VB6. I am an Auth0 Ambassador and a Google Developer Expert in WebTechnologies and I’ve been living in Prague, Madrid and (starting in January) in Austin, TX.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The ability to travel and see new places. I think I’ve been able to go on all the continents just because of the speaking engagements I had, which would have been impossible otherwise.</p>\n<p>Second? Networking with speakers; <strong>I met some of my best contacts I have in the space because of the conferences,</strong> and I even ended up organising a conference because of some people I met in Paris last year. You never know who you’re talking to — and you can be surprised. Curiously enough, the content is really the last reason I’d go to a conference.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I have always refused to present basic-level stuff that you can easily find on the web (tutorials and documentation) or even worse marked products for the company I work for. <strong>So every 8-10 months I do kind of a retrospective of what I’ve been working on and if I see a fit for an interesting talk (such as something that you don’t exactly do everyday, something that has never been treated elsewhere)</strong> — I put up an abstract and a title and try to submit it around.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the topic is appreciated, but most of the times it is not. My point is — I want to share experiences, not technical documents in an oral form.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I totally remember it. It was in 2015 at the mDevCamp and I was asked to replace a colleague that couldn’t make it. I was in an horrible condition (I had fever) and it was at the very last moment. I didn’t want to leave the company unrepresented to I took the bet and had the presentation anyway.</p>\n<p>I must say, my English has improved since then, I promise.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hYvsept0oio' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>”<a href=\"https://slideslive.com/38894088/building-resilient-api-client\">Building resilient API client</a>” by Vincenzo Chianese at mDevCamp</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>In general, I apply to everything that makes sense, no matter the location or the timing of the year; that’s something I prefer to figure out later. Although I had a lot of speaking engagements, I still get rejected by default by most of the events. Some conference organisers that I met personally saw that I usually bring solid topics and so they were kind enough to invite me back. Anyway, I think my ratio is 1/5 (every 5 submissions, one goes through and gets accepted). You can do the math.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I found myself in the world of the conferences accidentally and I had basically no training. Here are some things I wish I would have done before doing this serially and seriously:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find a local Meetup in your native language. You need to get confident in front of the crowd and the meet-ups are perfect: low expectations, willingness to listen from the audience and the “even-if-everything-fails-nothing-happens” guarantee that will make you feel comfortable. Rinse and repeat 2-3 times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find a meetup in English, and try the same talk. You will probably have to pay for your own flight (although a lot of meetups in Europe give talks in English anyway), but it’s an investment, so totally worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time to apply to a conference.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’ve also wrote a small essay on what to keep in mind when sending a CFP to a conference, <a href=\"https://dev.to/vncz/a-reviewer-s-perspective-on-getting-your-conference-proposal-accepted-1e6p\">sharing some thoughts as an organiser</a>.

It’s a lot like the interviews I do here on CFP Land!</p>\n<p>So, I’m very excited to bring you Tanay’s speaker story today.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rNiq6xr.png?1\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://crate.io/\">Crate.io</a> which means I am working closely with the community of engineers using CrateDB. I am speaking at a lot at conferences, holding webinars, writing tutorials and articles. I got into public speaking after joining a program called <a href=\"https://events.mozilla.org/techspeakers\">Mozilla Tech Speakers</a>. I gave my first talk in 2016 in Russia.</p>\n<p>I have been going to conferences for a while now and I have met some truly amazing speakers from whom I have learnt a lot. I thought, why not record our conversations and make them available as a podcast so that a lot more people can benefit from it? This is a side project that is very dear to me on which I am concentrating on these days. It is called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">Technically True</a> and I chat with inspiring people in the industry to gain insights on topics related to public speaking and developer relations.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Initially, one of the strongest incentives was travelling to new places. Over time, the thing I liked the most about this was meeting new developer communities, engaging with them and of course, speaking and sharing what I have been working on.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences helped me gain more exposure and until the end of 2018, it was something that I did just for fun. Then I realised that I used up almost all of my vacation days for speaking at conferences and that now maybe it is time that I should do this full-time. That is when I decided to quit my job and join Crate.io this year as a full-time Developer Advocate. It’s been almost a year that speaking has been a part of my daily work and I’m lovin’ it!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>These days, I have been speaking a lot about databases, industry 4.0, machine and time-series data. I especially enjoy talking about case-studies related to IoT that we do with our clients. I also speak on WebXR with A-Frame and building multiplayer games with that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Sure, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was very thrilled about it but got very nervous the day before I had to give the talk. I experienced a cocktail of feelings like impostor syndrome, adrenaline rush and anxiety. Once I started speaking, I realised that I was really enjoying it and all the fear melted away. The talk went well, I had a lot of questions and the feedback was good. I watched the recorded video later on and identified a lot of things that I had to fix like filler words and so on. It’s not easy to watch a video of your talk but trust me, it can be the best way to improve your speaking skills. I even have a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZTJOhz6INQ\">my first talk on YouTube</a>, it helps me realize how far I have come and how far I still have to go.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZTJOhz6INQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>“Getting Started With Web Based Virtual Reality” by Tanay Pant (his first conference talk)</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied to? Hundreds! Spoken at? I think it is probably close to twenty-five.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that is the most important for me is putting my Slack, laptop and mobile on do not disturb. I always take off my watch before going on the stage - loose watches can create a distraction for both the speakers and the audience by going up and down the wrist. Smartwatches on the other hand can light up with hand movements. I use an app called HiddenMe for hiding all the icons, files and folders from my Desktop, especially if I have to give a demo and need to exit Powerpoint. I think that it’s important to have a bottle of water on the stage especially for longer talks.</p>\n<p>I recently talked about pre-talk rituals with Niels Leenheer and you can hear stories from us about the things we do and why we do them <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">in the episode coming out on December 1</a>.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Well, there’s SO many things. Let’s go through a speaker’s journey from picking a topic to chatting with the audience at the end of the talk.</p>\n<p>First of all, topic selection. It’s most important to choose something really interesting to you, something that you are passionate about. That plays a huge factor in how much confidence and enthusiasm you have when you are up on the stage. If you’d like to know more about CFPs and how conferences select talks, I can highly recommend following <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/talk-selection-in-conferences-with-kristina-schneider\">Kristina Schneider’s advice</a> on the topic (she organises CSSConfEU).</p>\n<p>Once your talk is ready, make sure to practice it well but also beware of over-rehearsing. Practising your talk a couple of times helps you to further tailor your talks and make them leaner. It also helps you with your confidence on stage in case something goes sideways.</p>\n<p>If something doesn’t go exactly as you wanted to on the stage or if the demo fails, make a joke about it and move on. Make sure that you have a video that you can show in its place. Don’t let it affect the rest of your talk and your morale. Things go wrong, it’s okay. This happens to everybody.</p>\n<p>Make sure you stick around after you talk to answer the questions from the audience and help them in any way you can. <strong>Never forget that the audience is the most important group in that room and always be humble.</strong> I can go on about this topic for hours, if you have more questions DO reach out to me.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One of the talks that have inspired me the most was given by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mio_Loclair\">Christian Mio Loclair</a> in Berlin about <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/273373088\">Narciss</a> back in 2018. Having said that, there are a countless number of people who have inspired me and I usually end up inviting them to my podcast. 😅</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am most active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanay1337\">Twitter</a> but I can also be found on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337\">LinkedIn</a>.

While many tech conference speakers do it for their own personal development, some are specifically hired to speak, travel, and be a face for the community. That’s what Nicolas does now, but like all speakers, it’s taken a journey to get there. In today’s Speaker Story, we hear how Nicolas got started as well as some of his tips for new conference speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m Nicolas Fränkel, a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a>. My main job is to speak at conferences, so that people know about Hazelcast the In-Memory-Data-Grid and <a href=\"https://jet.hazelcast.org/\">Jet</a>. I’m also the point of contact for the community.</p>\n<p>I’ve been a teacher for more than 20 years, given that the best way to learn is to teach. However, some subjects are not relevant in academia. I discovered the <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/\">Vaadin web framework</a>, and I was so enthralled by it that I wanted to show it to the members of my local Java User Group. That was 7 years ago.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EOLCiAD.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects! For example, last summer, I was feeling a bit down with so much travelling around. I arrived at my hotel just a couple of hours before a talk. I wasn’t happy to be there, but I went to give the talk. After that, I felt really better, all bad feelings had been washed away.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I started public speaking at my Java user group one evening. Soon afterwards, when I travelled for work, I started to propose local user groups to host my talk. Then, I took vacations to speak at international conferences. I did more and more of them. <strong>But at one point, I realized that was pretty dumb to be paid to do a dull job (consulting on development/architecture) while taking vacations to do something that I really liked.</strong> One year ago, I steered my career toward Developer Advocacy, which includes a large part of public speaking.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I’m a tech guy, so in general I stick to technical subjects. They include Java - it has been my bread and butter for years, Kotlin, Spring and Spring Boot, DevOps, Kubernetes and of course, Hazelcast IMDG and Jet.</p>\n<p>I once did a motivational talk, but it was quite hard for me. I might do more organizational/management-related talks in the future, as I already wrote some related blog posts already. But it means going far out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first talk at my local user group very vividly.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I was used to teach, but to talk in front of your peers is very different. <strong>When teaching, you speak from a position of power; when speaking in front of your peers, they will judge you - in a good or a bad way, and it will have a lasting effect.</strong> For this reason, I had asked some good friends to come, and they did. The room was overflowing with people, with some sitting on the stairs. I was very nervous before the talk, and in the first few minutes. Then, just like when coding, I focused on the subject at hand and went “into the zone”. I don’t remember the specifics afterwards, it was just “business as usual”.</p>\n<p>I believe the talk went pretty well, as I remember people clapping, and thus it was a great experience that helped me apply to speak again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don’t keep the count of the number of conferences I’ve submitted to, but to give you a rough idea, this year, I’ll speak at a total of 68 conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don’t have routine per se, but I like to be at my place and prepared far in advance (at least 20 minutes). Being early was useful for a conference at the earlier this year, when I noticed very early that the projector didn’t work, and I had to run to find someone to help me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Wow, answering this question could easily fill a book!</p>\n<p>Regarding impostor syndrome, the main advice would be the following: I often hear great and skilled people not submitting talks because they’re afraid they have nothing new to say. Well, if that would be the case, not many people would do public speaking. I believe on the opposite that <strong>most people have a unique experience and bring a unique viewpoint, even to subjects that have been spoken about a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>For finding conferences, I use <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a> and <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">sessionize.com</a>. They also allow to write your bio and abstract once, find your conferences, and then submit them at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>For the rest, I already wrote a post named <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Advices for junior conference speakers</a> that might be of interest. Expect more to come in the future.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I became exposed to the world of Developer Advocacy through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaruch\">Baruch Sadogursky</a>. He was the one that made me understand by his behavior that public speaking could be a job - or at least a part thereof.</p>\n<p>For the sheer number of talks, I need to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbuxman\">Josh Long</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. As the latter told when he introduced himself during a panel is: “I’m Venkat, I live in a plane”. And then he passed the mic.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/\">blog where I publish a weekly post</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tChR2X7.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Other than being married to Liron and a father to Yaara and Yuval, I’m also working at Nielsen, the data and measurement company. I work for a division called Nielsen Marketing Cloud, as the tech lead of the big data group (sometimes people confuse “tech lead” with “team lead”, so I wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/tech-lead-dont-you-mean-team-lead-c8bde92e38ab\">short post</a> to explain what I see as a tech lead 😃).</p>\n<p>In addition to that, I’m also a co-founder and a core team member of the Israeli chapter of <a href=\"https://www.womeninbigdata.org/\">Women in Big Data</a>.</p>\n<p>I actually got into public speaking more than 10 years ago, when I was invited to give a talk about Mainframes to a group of young soldiers during their basic programming course in the army. I really enjoyed it, and since then I’ve had the chance to talk about various topics in several different forums, ranging from internal sessions, through local meetups, all the way to international conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>While speaking at conferences is not part of my job per se, I’m sure it’s beneficial for my career in the long run, but that’s definitely not the main reason for me to do it. The main reason is actually the fact that it gives me an opportunity to meet a lot of smart people and share my knowledge with them - I absolutely love it!</p>\n<p>There are two added bonuses for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I get to attend other talks and learn from others as well.</li>\n<li>After I give a talk, people come up to me and ask questions, which always leads to very interesting conversations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bottom line - speaking at conferences is an awesome experience.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>In the last 7 years or so, I’ve been a big data developer and tech lead, so naturally I cover big data related topics, usually frameworks and tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Apache Druid.</p>\n<p>I’ve worked on data-centric systems since the early days of my career, and it’s funny how sometimes the terminology is similar, while the underlying technology has significantly evolved (e.g Mainframe batch jobs vs a Spark batch jobs). As a data engineer, it’s exciting to be able to use cutting-edge tools to process the ever-increasing amounts of data, and so is the opportunity to share with others how we actually use those tools.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I definitely remember that talk! It was a local conference about 2.5 years ago, where my colleague, Yakir Buskilla (who’s now our VP R&#x26;D), and I spoke about how we use Druid for interactive count-distinct queries at scale.</p>\n<p>It was the first time I gave a talk to such a large audience (about 400 people), and I was excited (and a bit nervous of course…). We got great feedback after the talk, so I guess you can say it went well.</p>\n<p>You can check out the video recording of that talk below (my part starts at 12:01 minutes):</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOIJEBIVFDY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>“Using Druid for Interactive Count Distinct Queries at Scale” with Yakir Buskilla and Itai Yaffe</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since I joined Nielsen, over 5 years ago, I applied to around 10 conferences, and was accepted to about 7 of them. 2019 has been extremely successful for me as a speaker, presenting and co-presenting at 5 different conferences throughout the year. I also speak at meetups and other forums quite often.</p>\n<p>And, I’ve already started working on my applications for next year’s conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I arrive a few minutes earlier to the location I’m going to talk at, and make sure everything is set-up properly. I also keep a bottle of water close by (just in case). Last but not least, it’s always helpful to pick a positive thought or idea that can lift your spirit and energize you right before getting on stage. I sometimes use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM\">Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now”</a> (apparently, this is even <a href=\"https://loudwire.com/queen-dont-stop-me-now-worlds-most-uplifting-song/\">backed by a scientific study</a>).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I can give, is to[read my blog post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/how-to-present-at-meetups-and-survive-and-what-does-freddie-mercury-have-to-do-with-it-614b22a7fa9b\">How to present at meetups and survive (and what does Freddie Mercury have to do with it?)</a> 😃</p>\n<p>But to summarize the tips from that post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Success doesn’t (usually) happen overnight, it takes a lot of work.</li>\n<li>Try to make your talk a story worth telling - people always want to hear real-life stories about how others have dealt with common challenges.</li>\n<li>Practice makes perfect - conduct a lot of dry-runs and get early feedback.</li>\n<li>Don’t let criticism get you down.</li>\n<li>Don’t let yourself get you down.</li>\n<li>Don’t forget to enjoy!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’ve been to several conferences and seen many great speakers, but I really look up to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\">Holden Karau</a> - her talks are always awesome, funny and insightful!</p>\n<p>She’s involved in quite a few open-source projects, and it’s really impressive she’s able to contribute to the open-source community both in terms of coding and in terms of sharing her knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I’d love to meet you at <a href=\"https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe\">Spark+AI Summit Europe</a> on October 15-17 in Amsterdam, where I’ll be talking about <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session_eu19/stream-stream-stream-different-streaming-methods-with-apache-spark-and-kafka\">different streaming methods with Spark and Kafka</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CXHhfJH.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I’m an Engineering Coach at Help Scout, and my daily job is to make sure that the engineers on my team are successful and that we’re shipping features that our customers love.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking at a young age. I did one-act plays in high school, and I also competed in <a href=\"https://www.uiltexas.org/speech/oral-interp/2019-20-uil-poetry-categories\">UIL poetry interpretation</a>. I’ve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity’s ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences!</p>\n<p>I give my talks because <strong>I believe that I have something to say that will help the attendees be better at the work they do</strong>. So, speaking is a way that I can help people, and helpfulness is one of my core values. There’s nothing better than the feeling I get when people come up to me after my talk (or sometimes weeks/months later) and tell me how it changed the way they thought about the topic. It’s even better when they share how it changed their behavior!</p>\n<p>Speaking isn’t part of my job, but it has greatly benefited my career. During job interviews, <strong>I’ve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!</strong> While giving great talks alone wouldn’t have gotten me the offer, being qualified and a good speaker has been an incredible combination!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>My two primary topics are technology leadership and diversity and inclusion. My technology leadership talks draw on core principles as well as historical examples.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/leadership-lessons-from-the-agile-manifesto/\">Leadership Lessons from the Agile Manifesto</a> talk takes the values of the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and distills lessons for engineering managers and technical leads. I give easy to understand guidelines for making the tough decisions that leaders have to make when guiding engineering teams.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/technical-leadership-through-the-underground-railroad/\">Technical Leadership Through the Underground Railroad</a> talk uses the story of the daring John P. Parker who was a Conductor on the legendary Underground Railroad. I use his experience helping a group of enslaved people in 19th Century America escape from the Slave States to freedom.</p>\n<p>I give a talk with my wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons, called <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/managing-the-burnout-burndown/\">Managing the Burnout Burndown</a>, and we use the burndown chart used my many Agile teams as a metaphor for burning down stress. We describe how protecting your health, forming strong relationships, and removing distractions can help you avoid burn out.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/lending-privilege/\">Lending Privilege</a> talk describes how everyone has privilege and can use it to create a more diverse and inclusive technology industry. We can all help those who lack our privileges be more visible, have their voices heard, and get a chance to contribute their expertise to the software development process at our companies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at Podcamp Houston back in 2009. I think it went very well!</p>\n<p>My talk was called “Restoring Tech Cred to Houston”, and I made the case for Houston being an often overlooked tech hub when compared to other areas of the country like Silicon Valley, New York City, and Austin. One thing that’s important to know about this first talk was that I had the fortune of getting a lot of speaking experience as a normal part of my job. As an engineering manager, I did a lot of speaking as a person tasked with leading development teams. Of course, this work was done inside company walls and was not visible to the public. However, I found that when I did start public speaking I already had a great set of skills just from what I did at work.</p>\n<p><strong>So, if you’re a new speaker, you probably are more experienced than you realize if your job requires you to do a lot of communication (even if it’s just in small team meetings or Slack conversations).</strong></p>\n<p>My first large conference talk was at South by Southwest in 2010, and I went on to speak there several times. I started to really get serious about speaking at conferences when I did a Lightning Talk at OSCON in 2016. That’s when my public speaking work really began to take off!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I would guess over 500. I’ve spoken at about 50 conferences so that tells you how tough the ratio of applications to acceptances can be.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a numbers game, and <strong>you shouldn’t let the rejection emails get you down</strong>. I’ve spoken at conferences on three different continents, and I still regularly get rejected. Keep applying and refining your proposals. You’ll start getting acceptances which usually lead to a higher acceptance rate.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine is meant to minimize variables and distractions as much as possible. I avoid drinking or eating anything two hours before my talk. That reduces the chance that I’ll have an upset stomach or have to deal with digestion issues. I may drink coffee, but no later than 30 minutes before I go on stage (to avoid being too jittery).</p>\n<p>I make sure I’ve been mic’d and have done a sound check and laptop check at least 30 minutes before my talk. I want to make sure that the mic is working, my slides are properly displayed on the screens, and my clicker (I use a <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote\">Logitech Spotlight</a>) and laptop are both fully charged.</p>\n<p>I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified. 😃</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you have something to say</strong>. Even an entry level talk can provide a ton of value. There is always someone who is new to the topic and needs help understanding the core concepts. Also, <strong>even people who are experts need reminders best practices and first principles</strong>. So, don’t count yourself out just because you think you’re not an expert.</p>\n<p>Second, pick one or two topics that you’re passionate about and use those for your talk proposals. You know you’re passionate about a topic if you’re already spending a lot of time reading about it, thinking about it, and debating it with people on Twitter. Wrap your talks around your passions. That way, you won’t get tired of your talks (it can happen over time), and the audience will sense your excitement. If you’re not excited about what you’re talking about, then how can the people in the seats get excited about you?</p>\n<p>Third, rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. I’ve given a lot of talks, and I still get nervous. However, the best remedy I’ve found for anxiety about stepping on stage is rehearse. You don’t have to memorize everything you’re going to say, but you need to have a solid idea of the journey you’re taking the audience on in your talk.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I look up to and have been inspired by so many speakers.

After speaking at local several meetups, Adrián started applying to conferences and has now been a speaker at 4 international gatherings. One of my favorite parts about speaking is the same as Adrián’s: meeting people from around the world.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sZRtBDT.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>My name is Adrián Bolonio. I’m an experienced Spanish Frontend developer and Web Team Lead, focusing now in Web Accessibility (a11y). Since 2012 I’ve been living and working in Vienna. I currently work at <a href=\"www.willhaben.at\">willhaben</a>, the biggest classified company in Austria with the 2nd highest traffic of all Austrian websites.</p>\n<p>I started speaking at local meetups in Vienna, such as ViennaJS, ReactJS and then I talked at the DevFest Vienna, organised by the local Google Developer Group. I had the opportunity to organise an internal frontend conference inside my company for 100 people and I gave a talk as well there. I’m now sending more CFPs to International conferences to continue my speaking path.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like the feeling to contribution to the community. Sharing the knowledge I’ve acquired over the years as a developer helps me improve my public speaking skills as well. Another thing that I love from conferences is networking and meeting new and amazingly interesting people from all over the world who share your interest and sometimes even hobbies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first talk. It was in the Vienna JS meetup, and I talked about a new library my team and I built at my current company. The idea was to share the library and promote it as open-source so anyone could use it. I was extremely nervous before going onto the stage, but the fact that my audience were developers too allowed me to relax a bit. At the end it went very well and smoothly. I got some very interesting questions after the talk and the people liked it.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJXzyHHh4pc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adrián Bolonio at ViennaJS</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve applied to around 15 international conferences so far. In the last 2 years I’ve been accepted to 4 conferences and several meetups.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKYA-7tczuk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adrián Bolonio on Accessibility at DevFest Vienna, 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>At the beginning I was nervous and my only routine was trying to calm down. Now I’m a bit more experienced, so I check that my computer has enough battery or I have a charger that works. I check that all my other applications are closed and my notifications are muted. I check that the microphone works properly and the screen where the presentation is shown is readable from any point in the venue.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think the best and more difficult advice is “calm down”.</p>\n<p>It’s ok to be a bit nervous, but try to understand that if you have been chosen to give a talk at a conference or at a local meetup it’s because you’re an expert in that field, so you know what you’re talking about. Just calm down, enjoy the talk, and accept any feedback.</p>\n<p>It needs to be fun for you, you don’t have to suffer, so please enjoy the process.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Since I’m very focused now on Web Accessibility I follow a lot of experts, but some of them are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo\">Manuel Matuzovic</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_sergeikriger\">Sergei Kriger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next speaker appearance in a conference will be at the <a href=\"https://jsconf.co/\">JSConf Colombia</a> on October 18th &#x26; 19th, 2019.

On the side, I am also working on growing DevLifts, a company I started to help developers get fit.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking through starting to speak at local meetups a few years ago, and then subsequently running 3 meetups and having a hard time finding speakers sometimes.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences because I get to share my ideas with a lot of people in a conversational (and more human) manner (as opposed to Twitter) and have those ideas put to the test. I also love getting to meet lots of new developers! Attending conferences is obviously a way to do that, but speaking can make it easier since people will want to come talk to you after your talk.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I actually just gave my first conference talk earlier this month! Going into it, I was a little nervous just because I was covering a fairly sensitive topic (fitness &#x26; health), but it went great. I got to meet a bunch of developers and hear about what they do to stay fit and healthy.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Until recently, I had applied to maybe 5-6 conferences and been rejected by all by 1. But in the past 2 months I got more aggressive with it and have applied to 30ish conferences. I’ve been accepted by 3 so far.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>About 15 minutes before, I’ll make sure to find the MC (or whoever is in charge of getting me to the right place for my talk) and checking in with them so they know where I am. I’ll have a glass of water and go to the bathroom. Then I’ll grab another glass of water to sip throughout the talk if necessary. I’ll also turn my phone off and put it in my backpack or somewhere not on my person. Most importantly, I always make sure my notifications are muted!!!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> gave me some fantastic advice before my first conference talk. I was a bit nervous and he said, “You’re not nervous. You’re excited.”</p>\n<p>Nervousness is inward focused — I’m afraid I’ll screw up, I’m afraid something will go wrong, I’m afraid they’ll hate my talk, I’m afraid I’ll start Twitter war.</p>\n<p>Being excited is outward focused — I’m excited to give this talk to help others with this area of their lives. I’m doing this because I want to help other developers. If at least one person walks away feeling good/empowered/excited/etc., I’ll be happy.</p>\n<p>As a conference organizer, I’ll also say to new speakers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Show up early (at least an hour before your talk). This makes the organizers much less stressed if they know you are in the building because they’ve seen you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure the MC can find you 15-20 minutes before your talk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice your talk. If you didn’t, it’s obvious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be flexible. Organizing conferences is hard and usually being done for free as a labor of love. Being a diva because you can’t get a certain type of water will definitely get you on the <em>do-not-invite-back</em> list.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>So many, but here are a few:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> is hands down the best speaker I know. I love being part of his audience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler\">Ken Wheeler</a> has the best combination of jokes and crazy good demos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dabit3\">Nader Dabit</a> got me into speaking because he’s one of the first people I saw give a tech talk at our local meetup years ago.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a> because daaaaaang does that dude know how to keep a crowd engaged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\">Brian Holt</a> because his talks have always been funny, mind-blowing, and approachable to me.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next scheduled conference talk is at <a href=\"https://connect.tech/\">Connect.tech</a> this October!

Building demos can really help you with learning the ins and outs on a topic and you never know what you may uncover.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Advice I’d give to new speakers before they give a talk is to remember these are regular people who are rooting for you. And the biggest step is to just be there. And when it’s over, it’s over. Afterwards you’re free to roam, explore and breathe.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to be an expert, just be passionately curious. Follow @cfp_land, have an interesting talk title and abstract (summary of what your talk would be on) and just submit to every conference that’s relevant to your interests. You can submit multiple talks and I highly encourage you do so. People call this “conference-driven development”. The submissions are reviewed and approved MONTHS before the conference actually happens so you’ll have time.</p>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eveporcello\">Eve Porcello</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a> are my top inspirations.</p>\n<p>CascadiaJS was the first conference I’ve ever attended and as stated, it occurred in November 2018. Eve Porcello invited me to her GraphQL workshop at CascadiaJS in Seattle and seeing how comfortable she was presenting on such an advanced topic was so inspiring. And then to know she’s authored O’Reilly books and travels doing conference talks and workshops for a living BLEW. MY. MIND.</p>\n<p>Then I meet Marcy Sutton who embraced me after I spoke on stage about my story. Her passion around accessibility and learning more about her role in developer advocacy is literally why I do what I do today. They are both the reason why I’ve pursued accessibility and developer advocacy. I want to be able to use my interest in writing and community engagement to make an impact and have a nomadic career.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/TaelurAlexis\">follow me on Twitter</a> and I post weekend recaps on what I have going on in my life <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TaelurAlexis\">on YouTube here</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m building an online platform called <a href=\"https://codeeveryday.io/\">CodeEveryday</a> where I’m providing learning resources, mentorship and job postings so you can subscribe to the newsletter as we prep for the release!

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sU57xj3.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am currently the Lead Site Reliability Engineer at Kenna Security. I have been working at Kenna for almost 4 years now and I got into public speaking last year thanks to the support at Kenna.</p>\n<p>My lead at the time suggested that I find ways I could share my knowledge with others. I had become extremely proficient and knowledge about making performance improvements in our Ruby application so I started with sharing that knowledge internally and then decided to try submitting a talk on it to a conference. I submitted a proposal to RubyConf not thinking anything would come of it. Because my expectations were low I also submitted a talk to a local meetup about another technical passion of mine, Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, BOTH talks were accepted and my Fall quickly became very busy. I had done debate and was good at speaking in high school, but I was not sure what to expect from technical speaking. After giving my first talk and seeing the response it got and how thankful the people were, I was hooked! It has been less than a year since that first talk and I have given 2 conference talks since, plus a few Meetup talks.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I enjoy being able to share my advice with a lot of people at once. It is like mentoring or giving advice on steroids. I also really enjoy getting out of the office and getting to meet other devs. Everyone has such difference experiences and being able to chat with everyone is a great way to bring back new ideas and learn new things.</p>\n<p>It has definitely benefited my career because I have made so many amazing professional connections via speaking. All of my talks were inspired by my work, but are not required for me to do my job. The speaking and additional connections I have made have also benefited Kenna as well in the form of bringing in job candidates. Kenna has been very supportive of all the speaking and covers all of my expenses whenever I speak.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>You bet I do since it was last November! It went fabulous! For a few days after I was on a high from it.</p>\n<p>I have looked up to many speakers and the idea of me being up on the stage was almost something I couldn’t comprehend. Once I did it, I was amazed with myself and also immediately ready to do it again! My only regret was that I left my necklace on and that interfered with the mic near the end. I was worried that it might have been horrible for those listening, but no one said anything. I don’t think many people even noticed. Being a perfectionist, I definitely did. But live and learn!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEi-vYcyTT8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2018-cache-is-king-get-the-most-bang-for-your-buck-from-ruby\">Cache is King: Get the Most Bang for Your Buck From Ruby by Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I have spoken at 3 conferences and applied to probably 9, some of which are this fall so I am waiting to hear back about those. The 3 conferences I have spoken at have all been Ruby conferences which have been incredible! A couple I applied to in the Fall are Site Reliability and DevOps conferences. I am interested, if accepted, to see how they differ.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I am a big proponent of practicing my talk!</p>\n<p>I know some people who prefer not to practice and they do better when they wing it, but I am not one of those people. I like to know exactly what I am going to say when I get up there. Because of that I practice my talk a lot and I memorize my intro and ending so those are guaranteed to go smoothly. Right before I talk I like to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en\">Power Pose</a>. But when I Power Pose, I do it with a twist. I recite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zFHkBQBg-4\">these lines from Jr in Cool Runnings</a> All of that helps me feel really confident and bad ass before I go on.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I have for new speakers, especially those who feel intimidated by speaking at a conference, is to start small. <strong>Begin by giving talks internally at your company first.</strong> It could be as simple as giving a demo of a feature you built. From there, consider lightening talks at a conference or even a talk at a Meetup. Once you are comfortable, then apply to a conference.</p>\n<p>If you are a new speaker that has already been accepted to give a conference talk then my best advice would be to <strong>give your talk in a smaller setting about a month before</strong>. This forces you to get the talk done early which will save you from last minute, frantic cramming. It will also allow you to get some feedback on the talk. I gave my first conference talk 3 times before RubyConf. I gave it at 2 small meetups and once for my coworkers. Every time I got great feedback that I was able to use to tweak the talk and make it more clear and approachable.</p>\n<p>Picking a topic can also be a struggle for people who want to get started, but sometimes feel they have nothing “new” to talk about. First and foremost, <strong>ANY topic is fair game even if people have talked about it before</strong>. You can always bring a new perspective to a topic. Even presenting new examples for a topic could help someone who has heard the topic a thousand times finally understand it. My first conference talk I wrote, Cache is King, I thought for sure it was too “simple” and not “innovative” enough to ever be considered. But I quickly learned, most conference talks aren’t about discovering something new, they are about taking a topic and presenting it in a way that is approachable and helps your audience learn something.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek\">Saron Yitbarek</a> has been HUGELY inspirational as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/r00k\">Ben Ornstein</a>.</p>\n<p>Right after I got accepted to speak at my first conference I watched Saron’s talk on building a community which gave me all the good feels I needed to believe I could take on this daunting task. I then watched Ben Ornstein’s talk on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JXH7JPjR4\">How to Give a Technical Talk</a> and that really inspired me to make my speech relatable and entertaining. My favorite quote is, “You can’t teach them anything if you don’t have their attention”</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have been pretty good about keeping my personal website up to date and that is <a href=\"https://www.mollystruve.com/\">www.mollystruve.com</a>. There I have links to my Twitter, blog, Instagram, Facebook, etc. I am also very passionate about blogging so I would be remiss if I didn’t include a link directly to my blog, <a href=\"https://dev.to/molly_struve\">dev.to/mollystruve</a>.</p>\n<p>I am a big fan of taking a talk and breaking it down into blog posts so it can reach more people.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m a Lead Designer at 8th Light, a custom software consultancy. I do UX and front-end development and work with various clients on designing and building their software.</p>\n<p>I was never interested in public speaking, but before I became a designer about 3 years ago I worked at an education-focused non-profit, and have a background in teaching, so I’ve always been pretty comfortable in the very small scale stage of a classroom. Before I started at 8th Light I volunteered doing a workshop about domestic violence, and part of my apprenticeship involved doing a talk for a small group of people, and I did that workshop.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of positive feedback, and eventually did a version of it at our internal company conference. A while later, a co-worker who was organizing a Ruby conference asked me to do a short talk about how developers could do quick usability testing, so that they could have good UX of features they were building when there wasn’t a designer in the room. That talk went pretty well despite the fact that I felt like I was going to pass out the entire time.</p>\n<p>I did that talk at another conference, but quickly felt a strong urge to go back to speaking about something I really cared about. I had been thinking for a long time about the ways that technology enables domestic violence, and had been collecting examples, but never felt like I was an “expert” enough to do a talk about it. It really seemed like something that other, smarter people were working on. But eventually I realized that wasn’t true, that if someone out there was already talking about this stuff, I couldn’t for the life of me find them.</p>\n<p>Right around that time, Russ Unger, who leads UX Camp in Chicago, responded to a proposal I’d submitted saying my topic wasn’t quite right, and he asked “is there anything else you’ve though about doing a talk about?” I told him about my idea for a talk about how tech enables domestic violence, and he said that would be perfect for the conference. I owe him a lot for taking the time to figure out that this talk was on my mind and giving me what I needed to finally do it. It took dozens of hours of research and stitching together stories from news articles and people who had disclosed their experiences to me to make my talk, but I finally did it, and ever since UX Camp I’ve had a lot of success with it.</p>\n<h3>What do you focus on speaking about?</h3>\n<p>My speaking is all about how technology enables domestic violence; how abusers can utilize technology to further their power and control over their victims, and how products that don’t enable abuse but are clearly spaces where survivors are taking certain actions that disclose the abuse and meaningful intervention could be provided (“Survivor” is the preferred term instead over “victim”, since it speaks to the person’s ability to endure and survive a dangerous situation.)</p>\n<p>I tell a story about someone experiencing domestic violence in 5 different areas, give stats that correlate to those areas, and describe ways that more thoughtful design or building of the product could prevent the abuse. The 5 areas are financial abuse through online banking tools, harassment and monitoring through “smart” home devices/Internet of Things devices, stalking through GPS-enabled devices, personal security through software such as building management software, and how fitness, wellness, and pregnancy products could be a place of meaningful intervention.</p>\n<p>I think it goes without saying that domestic violence is a worthwhile thing to do a talk about, but just in case you need convincing, here are some stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 in 3 American women will experience severe physical abuse at the hands of an intimate partner.</li>\n<li>For men, that number is 1 in 4. Domestic violence is not an edge case.</li>\n<li>The number one cause of death among pregnant women in America is murder by her current or ex intimate partner.</li>\n<li>3 women are murdered by their current or ex intimate partners in America each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I don’t see myself as a “public speaker” - I really just want to spread the content of my talk because I think it’s really important.</p>\n<p>But I’ve learned a few things: <strong>first, as someone who gets a lot of stage fright, the only thing that helps is just doing it a bunch.</strong> After 4 or 5 times talking a stage, it started to get a lot easier. After doing it a bunch and not dying, you start to realize it’s going to be ok. That’s the advice I give people who ask about speaking even though they’re not a natural public speaker - you have to just do it, but then it quickly gets a lot easier.</p>\n<p><strong>The second thing I like about speaking at conferences is that I also get to attend them!</strong> I think I’ve grown in my career more rapidly than average in part because of attending half a dozen conferences in the past few months and learning a ton. My advice is to focus on applying to conferences you’d actually want to attend, so that they’re also a learning experience for you. I can only do so many conferences in a year, so I figure I might as well prioritize speaking at ones I also want to attend.</p>\n<p><strong>The third thing I like is that speaking at conferences unexpectedly helped with my social anxiety a lot.</strong> I’m introverted and socially anxious, but so many days of having strangers come up and talk to me about my talk, and share their experiences with violence, was the intense exposure I needed to start to get past my social anxiety. Within 6 months, I’ve become so much more confident talking to strangers and being in new situations that would have induced a lot of anxiety in the past - all thanks to conference speaking. I really want people to know that you can be introverted, awkward, and socially anxious, and still be a great conference speaker and get a ton of benefit from doing it.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>7 so far, with a few more confirmed for the fall - include StrangeLoop, which I almost didn’t apply to because it seemed like such a long shot! I’ve applied to about 40, and gotten 10 rejections, with the other 23 still up in the air.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhWPnKg4oK4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Eva PenzeyMoog: Designing Against Domestic Violence</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Deep breathing! And lots of practice, to the point that you don’t need to rely on speaker notes. It makes such a difference.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Two things:</p>\n<p><strong>You do NOT need to have the talk written before you write a proposal for that talk to apply to conferences with, and you do NOT need to already be an expert in the field that you’re proposing a talk about.</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling like you need to know and do so many things before even applying to something you might get rejected from is a surefire way to get overwhelmed and never start. Choose something you’re legitimately interested in and would want to become an expert in, write the proposal and apply to as many conferences as possible. Once you get accepted to one, then create the talk and learn all about it. You don’t need to present the answers in your proposal. I wish someone had spelled this out for me earlier on - I would have started applying with this talk a lot sooner!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie\">Sara Wachter-Boettcher</a> is a huge inspiration. She keeps it real - she’ll call out the chatbot you’re using at your conference for defaulting to a woman’s name, and point out all the ways Facebook is terrible when a table full of Facebook designers is right in front of her. I really value that, and before her, had seen plenty of men behave that way, but no women. She’s not afraid to hold people accountable, but doesn’t make it personal. She strikes a perfect balance, and getting to see her speak and attend one of her workshops was incredibly valuable to see as I’m working on developing my own speaking style. I was lucky enough to randomly be seated with her at a shared table at a restaurant we were both at after I saw her talk at a conference, and got to ask her all my questions and get amazing advice. I think that was the moment I started to feel like the universe really wants me to do this work. Serendipitous things like that keep happening. And I’m trying to pay it forward - I’m all about getting more women and other underrepresented voices into the conference speaking circuit.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My website is <a href=\"https://evapenzeymoog.com/\">evapenzeymoog.com</a> and my Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/epenzeymoog\">@epenzeymoog</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Eva PenzeyMoog, Designer Helping Stamp Out Domestic Abuse","path":"/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/26","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PZhgAIc.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I started my career as a UX designer at a design agency. <strong>Being an introvert, I was very uncomfortable speaking in meetings and used to literally run away from having the spotlight on me.</strong> I even had a hard time speaking in front of my own team. Each time I stood up to talk I would get the classic symptoms such as dry mouth, profuse sweating, and forgetting what I wanted to say. It was frustrating because I noticed others who would get up and speak effortlessly and I wanted that for myself. I wanted to be able to get up and speak without hesitation and share my ideas.</p>\n<p>It was time to act.</p>\n<p>So I decided to turn things around and searched for ways to improve my public speaking skills. My search led me to a 30-day online speaking challenge which focused on specific areas in public speaking such as speed, filler words, pacing, etc. The last exercise of the challenge was to create a presentation of my own and record myself presenting it. At that time I was also diving into the world of sketching so I created a 5-minute talk about sketching journey. To test out my presentation I needed real people to present it to so I searched for meetups and found a developer meetup which was looking for presenters for their next meetup. Their CFP page was very inviting towards new speakers which gave me the confidence to apply. I jumped on the chance and submitted my talk proposal and that’s when my public speaking journey began.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>For me, it’s all about the people. Whether it’s someone who connects with my message or another speaker who is just starting out, I love meeting new people and making friends at conferences.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don’t know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of speaking at conferences is that each conference brings its own challenges such as room layouts, the acoustics of rooms, the size of the audience, the distance to the audience, lighting, etc. these all present challenges that help us grow.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first conference talk very clearly because it was started out a bit rough. I was really nervous before the event because I didn’t know anyone in the sea of people. The layout of the room I was presenting it was a bit challenging. There was a big column right in the middle of the room which divided the audience into two sides. The windows were from floor to ceiling which sounds nice but made it extremely difficult to see my slides. We had to turn off the lights to be able to see them so I presented my talk in the dark, talk about throwing you off your game. As I began my presentation I noticed the people in the audience with their expressionless stares which made me think I was boring them. This started the negative self-talk in my head while I was presenting which never turns out well and it caused me to read my slides instead of looking at the audience. Towards the end, I felt much better and more in control of my talk. After the event, I felt a bit disheartened but I was determined to learn from the events of the day and improve for the next time.</p>\n<p>Each new talk presents challenges and opportunities to learn from and to help us grow. I am still learning from my “mis-takes” and addressing the areas I need to improve in. It’s important to keep in mind that public speaking is a continuous learning process. Never stop learning.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/REn0gvq.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I haven’t kept count but I know I have applied to many conferences. My CFP rejected-to-win ratio is probably around 0.00001 which is definitely an exercise in learning how to accept rejection and not take it personally.</p>\n<p>I have presented at 6 conferences in the US and in Europe. My talk recently was accepted at a conference in Oslo which improves the ratio just a little bit.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>A week before my talk, my routine consists of getting a fresh haircut and picking out the outfit I will wear. I also make sure I have all the dongles, adapters, cables, remotes I need.</p>\n<p>On the day of the talk, I make sure I have a good breakfast and pack a few snacks just in case I get hungry before the talk.</p>\n<p>If I am speaking at a conference, I make sure to scope out the room I will be presenting in beforehand to check out the stage and seating arrangements. This way I can visualize myself up on the stage presenting beforehand, which help me feel prepared.</p>\n<p>Right before giving my talk I will do some breathing exercises, and if I really need to get pumped up then I will find stairs nearby and go up and down them quickly to warm up and get my blood flowing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>I recommend new speakers look for opportunities to present at work, meetups, schools, basically anywhere they can.</strong> At work, you can present at a Lunch and Learn session. Don’t have a Lunch and Learn session at work? Why not start one? This will give you the opportunity to present regularly and get more practice. Meetup organizers are always looking for new people to present and share their ideas. You can also start off with Lightning Talks which are short 5-minute presentations on any topic you want and are a great entry point to start your public speaking journey.</p>\n<p>Another tip I like to share is to make your talk interactive. <strong>Find ways to get your audience engaged with your message through exercises, questions, or discussions.</strong> Getting the audience involved will help them connect with your message on a deeper level and when the audience is engaged I notice that I relax more and become less anxious since.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Inspiration is everywhere. Whether it’s a team member presenting at work, a speaker at a conference, or kids presenting at an elementary school, I find inspiration by observing people and how they communicate. I have presented my talks at elementary schools and I’m especially inspired by the confidence kids have in standing up and sharing their ideas without hesitation which is something I am working towards.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>A good thing about having a somewhat unique name is that if you Google Rizwan Javaid, I will show up. Not personally, that would be creepy but the search results will be mostly about me.

My current role is V.P. of Development, which entails leading the development department and the individuals in it. My day ranges anywhere from meeting with clients, building project estimates to fixing bugs, building features or leading technical architecture for a client project.</p>\n<p>I first got into public speaking by presenting lightning talks at local technology meetups. I started by asking development questions, presenting about projects I was working on and demoing solutions I had built. <strong>As an introverted person I was nervous about getting in front of and speaking to a large group of people.</strong> I knew for myself and for progression in my career, public speaking was something I wanted to improve on.</p>\n<p>In 2013 I started submitting talks to conferences and forced myself into the deep-end.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LLmOZiu.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Submitting talks is a great excuse to learn something new.</strong> When I submit a talk proposal it’s usually on a topic that I am not an expert on, but one that I am interested in learning more about. I then have a motivator to deep dive into the topic to learn about it. This has the challenge of learning enough about a topic to be able to present it in a way that others can understand.</p>\n<p>For technical talks in particular, this means being able to break down the subject into basic terms and concepts. This practice has come in very helpful for my career and day job interacting with clients. Being able to explain technical issues or aspects of your project in simple ways is very helpful for improving communication abilities.</p>\n<p>More self-serving is the added benefit of being able to travel to different locations around the world to present talks. Most technical conferences will cover the ticket cost (and sometimes airfare and lodging) for speakers. This affords me the opportunity to visit places I may not be able to on my own and get introduced to new communities of people. The benefit to my career from this is that I’m able to grow my professional network. As well as, I have opportunities to listen to a large range of talks by other great speakers.</p>\n<p>Finally there is the benefit of building up my self confidence. <strong>The more I present the more confident I become in my abilities to do so.</strong> This has helped with my social anxiety and with my ability to interact with clients or potential clients. Thanks to my years of public speaking I am now not afraid to join in on conversations with little or no preparations and be confident in what I am going to say.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was in June 2013 at the conference Design 4 Drupal, hosted at MIT in Cambridge MA. I co-presented with a co-worker on responsive design in a talk titled “Bumps in the Road to Responsive”.</p>\n<p>As it was my first time speaking in front of a large group, I remember being very nervous about it. To prepare for the talk my co-presenter and I printed out scripts of exactly what we were going to say. Then we practiced many, many times, all the way up until the hour before our scheduled time slot. I do not remember much about presenting (it was all a blur), but we made it through it. People stayed through the whole thing and we had many follow up hallway conversations - which means attendees took away something helpful.</p>\n<p>My second time presenting and first time presenting solo, was in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-RQxA4JH6w\">April 2014 at a conference hosted at the UN building in New York City</a>. Again, I was very nervous about presenting and spent weeks rehearsing my talk. I had moved away from printing out a script and relied on having practiced my talk. That did not help my nerves and I remember hyperventilating, and my hands shaking. Yet I managed to get through it and covered all the points I wanted to talk about. I even managed to throw in a few (bad) jokes in my talk. At the end, I was very proud of what I accomplished and how I managed to present on my topic.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-RQxA4JH6w' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Mike Miles, “To Patch Contrib or Write a Custom Module”</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since 2013, I have applied to 40 different conferences a majority of which have been tech focused. Of those 40 I have spoken at 34 conferences, presenting 38 talks on 9 different subjects. This has given me a chance to present at conference in 4 different countries (US, Canada, Iceland &#x26; Germany). On average I build about 1 - 2 new technical topics a year, and present each at 5 - 6 different conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>After every presentation I take time reflect on how well I did and think of ways I can improve my process. This has lead to an evolution of a pre-talk routine that works for me.</p>\n<p>My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. <strong>I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I present my talk to a brick wall and yes it looks and feels awkward, but that is the point.</p>\n<p>I practice the way I’ll present the talk to work out the quirks and get the flow correct. By the time I’ve spent a week doing this, presenting my talk becomes muscle memory. I then do not have to worry about what I’m going to say and can instead focus on how I’m saying it. This allows me to react to any audience questions and manage my allotted time. This is the most important part of my pre-talk of my routine. After this time I DO NOT edit my presentation, doing so would only throw everything off.</p>\n<p>The day before and day of my talk I prepare my body. <strong>I start by making sure to get to bed at a respectable time and get a full night’s rest.</strong></p>\n<p>The morning of I have a good breakfast and if possible practice one last time. The hardest part of this phase is that I do not drink any coffee or caffeine leading up to my talk. <strong>I have found that since I still get nervous any caffeine over activates my nerves and leads to me speaking quickly and being shaky during my talk.</strong> I also use the day before / morning of to prepare backups of my presentation. I create a PDF version (that I can then share with the audience), back up to a cloud service, create a short link and if possible place it on a USB device. This way if anything catastrophic happens to my laptop or the internet goes down, I can still give my talk.</p>\n<p>The hour before my talk I spend clearing my mind. I’ll take a break from the conference I’m at, take a small walk and focus my mind on nothing. This time gives me a chance to calm down and relax. Fifteen minutes before my talk I find the room I’ll be presenting in (if I have not already done so) and sit in on the talk currently being given (if there is one).</p>\n<p>Then it’s time for me to get on stage, hook up my laptop and start talking!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you do not have to be an expert to present on a technical topic.</strong> Build a presentation around an interest. You do not have to be a subject matter expert and building a talk is a great motivator to learn something new.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>practice, practice, practice and practice out loud!</strong> You will not get a feel for your talk by practicing it “in your head”. Practice the way you present your talk. Standing up, hooked up to a monitor and not facing your slides. This allows you to build a muscle memory around what and how you are going to present.</p>\n<p>Third, when possible <strong>practice your talk in front of a trusted friend or family.</strong> Ideally someone who is not knowledgeable of the material. They will catch things about your presentation that you are not aware of and give you helpful feedback on the story you are telling. I cannot tell you the number of spelling and grammar mistakes my wife has found in my presentations.</p>\n<p>Fourth, <strong>do not be the person that edits your presentation hours/minutes leading up to your talk.</strong> Doing so means you are going to have to figure out what you want say while presenting. Losing the message / lesson you want to convey to your audience.</p>\n<p>Number five is <strong>do not be afraid to submit your talk to many conferences.</strong> You do not need to build a new talk for every CFP and the information you’ve built will be beneficial for many audiences. Plus the more times you give your talk the better you will become at it.</p>\n<p>Finally, number six, <strong>mistakes will happen and when they do move on.</strong> I’ve seen some technical talks derailed because the presenter spent too long trying to get a code example to work, or wait for a file to load due to a bad internet connection. If something is not going correct, move on to the next part of your talk, your audience will thank you.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers who I have looked up to and have inspired my career as a technical speaker. The first is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Crell\">Larry Garfield</a>. Larry outlined the methods he’s used to build technical talks and his guidelines. These have helped me numerous times to build session proposals that have been accepted by conferences. <a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">You can read Larry’s guidelines here</a>.</p>\n<p>The second speaker is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eaton\">Jeff Eaton</a>. Every time I have seen Jeff present, it is with enthusiasm and passion for what he is presenting on. As an attendee at one of his talks you feel this in the way he presents and you walk away feeling empowered (at least this has been my experience). The way Jeff Eaton presents is something I have striven to replicate in my own presentation style.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Interested readers can find out more about me in a number of different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can hear my voice monthly as the <a href=\"https://www.developingup.com\">host of the Developing Up podcast</a> - a podcast that is focused on the non-technical side of being a developer and growing a career in development.</li>\n<li>I can be found on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devuppodcast\">@devuppodcast</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemiles86\">@mikemiles86</a>.</li>\n<li>All of my previous technical talks and upcoming speaking engagements can be found on my website at <a href=\"http://www.mike-miles.com\">www.mike-miles.com</a>.</li>\n<li>And I’m always happy to connect on LinkedIn at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/\">linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Mike Miles, Podcaster Focused on the Nontechnical Side of Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-mike-miles/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/16","image":"https://i.imgur.com/LLmOZiu.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests. At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>While Bailey has been practicing public speaking her whole life, she was drawn to speak at tech conferences after seeing so many design and development teams struggle to put their message online. One thing I love about speaking is getting to attend conferences and hear other talks - especially from subject-matter experts who are truly passionate about their craft. Bailey is one of those passionate people, and I’m excited to bring you her story here today.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m director of content strategy at usability consulting firm <a href=\"https://truematter.com/\">truematter</a> out of Columbia, South Carolina. I’m a user experience content strategist which means I plan, organize, and write the words people use to interact with websites, applications, and software products. I’ve been involved in public speaking throughout my life, especially when I was younger.</p>\n<p>Recently, I felt a call to pick it up again for many reasons but one in particular: design and development teams must change their approach to words online. Many, many organizations (including those that should know better) still write their online content the same way they would for traditional media. That approach drags down their product’s user experience, makes it harder for customers to engage with them online, and has a large negative impact on the success of their digital products. I set out to speak out about this widespread problem and how we should fix it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l6UnYFz.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I’m still pretty new on the conference scene but even so, <strong>I’ve already made a lot of connections with both people in my field and those outside of it.</strong> I think it’s a lot easier to meet people when you’re the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time – a real plus for an introvert like me.</p>\n<p>Also, I’ve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places – I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It went well! I think I was surprised when I found out that people do actually care a great deal about their digital content and want to know how to make it better and more usable. The audience had a ton of questions, which was great. The whole thing is kind of addicting. You experience it once and think, “I want to do that again.”</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve spoken at about ten events so far with another four or five already scheduled for later this year.</p>\n<p>I’ve applied to a lot more than that for sure. I probably send out three applications a month and that number has been growing lately. But <strong>the more I apply and the more I speak, the more conferences are approaching me instead of the other way around and that’s a really nice feeling.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATVKZdl_pEw?start=130' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Bailey Lewis at OKC Design Tech</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I always try to see the space before I speak in it. That could mean swinging by the room before my presentation or trying to find a video of a presentation someone else gave in that room online. Seeing the space before my presentation lets me decide where to stand and helps me understand how the audience will be looking at my slides (one big screen? multiple screens around the room? etc).</p>\n<p>Other than that, <strong>I take a deep breath and remind myself: The audience came to see me present on this topic.</strong> They want it to go well as much as I do. And that’s a lot more helpful than imagining them in their underwear.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>If you’re brand new, it might be hard to find speaking gigs that will cover your travel and accommodations. The conference might even ask you to pay to attend even though you’re speaking (not my favorite practice but there you have it).</p>\n<p>Take a few of these gigs if you need to so you can get started and get your name out there, but as soon as someone offers to cover your travel/accommodations, demand it every time you speak afterward. Even better if you can throw a speaker stipend into the mix. That will probably mean saying no to conferences you’d really like to speak at, which can be painful. But once you reach certain level in your speaking career, you shouldn’t be digging in your own pockets when you’re the one providing the presentation content that will sell conference tickets and make the event successful.</p>\n<p>By the way, <strong>I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.</strong></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’m not sure about specific conference speakers (although there are presentations I’ve really enjoyed), but my father is a trial attorney and, among other speaking-related lessons, he taught me the art of giving a presentation without swaying or fidgeting. He would record me giving a presentation and then have me watch it back – it was extremely effective for getting rid of the fidgets.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Find me at <a href=\"https://truematter.com/baileylewis\">truematter.com/baileylewis</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>When I was in college, I was paralyzed by the fear of public speaking. Just the thought of talking in front of a small class would cause cold-sweats. Fortunately, I was studying for a career in Comp Sci. which usually doesn’t require much public speaking.</p>\n<p>Once my career began, I was reaffirmed, no one wants to hear a developer speak. That was fine for a few years, and then new nagging energy began. People can’t listen if you don’t speak. Quietly interjecting important points without ever taking the lead of a conversation is less effective than not speaking at all. It was time to start breaking out of my shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Though I was uncomfortable, I started speaking up more and more.</strong> I attended conferences, and I marveled at speakers. I was amazed, but sure I would never be on the other side of the 4th wall.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can’t shut me up. It’s always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn’t comfortable, but it’s doable. Now <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">you can see I’ve been speaking actively for years</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m very fortunate that I work for the great people at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a> who have supported me from lightning talk to keynote speaker.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>The best thing about speaking at conferences is the networking and connection. I’ve made friends around the world.</strong> This has, directly AND indirectly, benefited my career and employer. It’s not required in my job description, but it’s valuable to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>There’s something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts. I’m still an introvert, but it doesn’t matter who you are, something like that feels great. The community and positivity of it all is superb!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>After a lot of Toastmasters, and speaking at a local meetup, my first “conference” talk was a lightning slot at RubyConf 2013.</p>\n<p>How’d it go? Well, my heart was beating through my chest. But I gave a 30-minute presentation in 5 minutes after getting over my fear of public speaking, so there was no way to fail :)</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJOkpP__dY4?start=4829' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Gant Laborde at RubyConf, 2013</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>50+ and no stopping in sight!</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XfgC3IW.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde/status/1107007420763639808\">general rules for sure</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No dairy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\">Power Pose</a></li>\n<li>Think more about your audience than yourself</li>\n<li>Realize the audience wants you to succeed, and they can’t see that you’re nervous unless you tell them.</li>\n<li>They will feel what you feel.

Then it’s to fill a room, then get invited to speak, then keynote.</strong> The best speakers are people who have been leveling up for 20+ years, and they support and promote speakers who are just getting started. It’s not a zero-sum game, ask for help, get feedback, and improve. Then repeat. The best speakers aren’t born speakers.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m Tejas. I love people and code and the conversations we have together. I’ve been a public speaker since a young age. I grew up with a fatal sickness (that I still have) where I couldn’t do much and I often felt like I’d never amount to much, so in some ways, I guess I’ve been drawn to public speaking to overcompensate. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MdV43uT.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like encouraging the community. I often learn things and I enjoy disseminating the information from stages and then having conversations about it later. <strong>Truth be told, I enjoy the private conversations that happen after a good talk <em>a lot</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>While it has directly benefited my career with a number of job offers, visibility, Twitter followers, all kinds of glitz and glam, the real value I see from this type of engagement is the love. I get to share hope with people, combat impostor syndrome, and see careers flourish; life change from a stage. It’s all very encouraging.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember doing a TEDx talk like 7 years ago. It was really well received. I think there was even a standing ovation. It was fun. 🙂</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUIcTl9Hto4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tejas presenting “Papercuts Can Kill” at TEDx</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I’ve applied to like 20 and spoken at like 9?

I have no real idea.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I often put myself into the mindset of “I’ve won” already before I even play.</strong> This gives me hope and like prepares me to do an amazing job. Eventually, it somehow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Odd, maybe, but it works for me every time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You’d be surprised by how much value you can add with a talk. Our tech industry today is so full of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1126096390281732097\">faux confidence and pretend knowledge</a> that one would often feel like they don’t know enough – I know I feel this way most of the time. The truth is, I actually know quite a bit <em>in my own, very specific area</em> that I can use to educate and help others who aren’t as familiar with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m often insecure about kubernetes, data structures and algorithms, and CS fundamentals because I personally was always too sick to get a Computer Science degree. I don’t have one. I am a prime example of impostor syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, I feel there are just as many people insecure about React, TypeScript, CSS and other areas. I rejoice at the idea of combating their impostor syndrome with my experience in these subjects. For me, this is part of the joy of public speaking along these themes.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been extremely uncomfortable with my <em>content</em> not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I’ve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to better my technical abilities to “close the loop”.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

He also speaks on behalf of <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">OSMI</a> - a great organization that helps raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech community - so I’m excited to present his journey into speaking and tips for those who are new to it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>During the day I’m a senior software engineer at a company called MoreCommerce where we do small and medium-sized business e-commerce and market place offerings. Outside of that, I help maintain various API related OSS projects like Fractal, openapi.tools, standards.rest and a few others. I spend most of my free time doing photography or cycling.</p>\n<p>As for speaking, I got my start at my old PHP user group in Atlanta. I started with a lightning talk and moved up to a full-length talk before breaking into a conference. Im usually pretty shy and quiet, so it was weird at first but it been a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about speaking is <strong>it’s an excuse to learn and play with new technology</strong>. I wouldn’t have become passionate about the OpenAPI spec if a conference hadn’t given me a chance to speak on it for example. And because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, <strong>giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn’t touch at work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It feels so long ago, but my first talk was at a now-defunct conference called “Great Wide Open”. I submitted a talk essentially about why community is awesome and how it can help someone learn. Since it was my first talk I was incredibly nervous but somehow I pulled it off. I got good feedback for it, and felt like I could have massaged it a bit into a more full talk.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>This year I will have spoken at 5, including 2 (maybe 3) keynotes. That’s the most I’ve ever done. Last year I spoke at one conference.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I usually put on some music, like Run The Jewels and just zone out.</strong> I tend not to sit in a talk before my slot so I can keep my thoughts going. Everyone is different, what works for me doesn’t mean it’ll work for someone else. I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing. I’m also bad in that I will still be doing slides up until my talk. I should fix that.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For your first talk, <strong>pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgable about.</strong> Don’t experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.</p>\n<p>When you submit your CFP, check your spelling and grammar. It’s amazing how many people overlook it.</p>\n<p>Another thing is <strong>don’t immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, submit multiple submissions, it gives you better odds. When we organized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/southeastphp\">Southeast PHP</a>, people with multiple submissions had a better shot getting into our post-apocalyptic Thunderdome over someone who only gave us one thing to choose.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty short so I look up to pretty much everyone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jenna Quindica</li>\n<li>Josh Holmes</li>\n<li>Kat Zień</li>\n<li>Phil Sturgeon</li>\n<li>Ben Edmunds</li>\n<li>Cal Evans</li>\n<li>Ed Finkler</li>\n<li>Alena Holigan</li>\n<li>Sammy Kaye Powers</li>\n<li>Ian Coldwater</li>\n<li>Olivia Liddell</li>\n<li>Nic Steenhout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so many more I can’t remember because I cycled 24 miles tonight so I’m tired.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRYimzIWS84' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>API Pain Points by Phil Sturgeon</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I blog occasionally at <a href=\"https://matthewtrask.net/\">matthewtrask.net</a> and post silly things like pictures of my dog at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewtrask\">@matthewtrask</a> on twitter.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Matthew Trask, Open Source Maintainer, Cyclist, and Speaker","path":"/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/06/26","image":"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

I’m thrilled to bring you Drishti’s story today, and hope it inspires you to get out and do some good in the world!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w36pjbN.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I am Drishti Jain a Computer Engineer at heart and a technology enthusiast. I love to use technology to help the less fortunate. I am a social entrepreneur. I am the Co-founder and President of the non-profit organisation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samyakdrishtifoundation\">Samyak Drishti Foundation</a> which works in environment, education and healthcare sectors in 10 cities across India. I have been titled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoptimistcitizen/p/BdT0mVJnMhU/\">Eco-Warrior thrice by the Government of Maharashtra, India</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been a good orator since a young age. I got into public speaking at school in grade 4; when I had to give a speech on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (for his birth anniversary). Ever since, I’ve loved the stage and sharing knowledge with all. Fun Fact: I also host music concerts sometimes :)</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences about things that I am passionate about. While I continue to learn new things and develop myself, I like to share my learning with others. Speaking at conferences, I am sharing with everyone about how cool a technology is or how I make the most of a feature. It gives me immense satisfaction to share my knowledge with all.</p>\n<p>I have learnt a lot speaking at conferences. I would like to share my secret weapon to effectively speaking in front large audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>My secret weapon – the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause.</strong> These are three key parts of speaking effectively at conferences. Using this paradigm, I am able to more effectively deliver my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Moreover, speaking at conferences I am able to share my learning with all and give them a head start in the technology. I am believer of “Learning by sharing Knowledge” and speaking at conferences just fuels that!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was an exciting experience. Post deciding my topic (after a lot of brainstorming) I realized that I had just entered the long hiking trail of preparing my talk, yet to embark. There was a mountain of information I had gathered through research on the topic. And I had to create my talk in a way that I would cover maximum information and make it interesting. <strong>It all seemed overwhelming at first; but I decide to sit and create a summary of the information, that made it easy to prepare my talk.</strong></p>\n<p>On the day of the conference, I reached the venue early and checked if my laptop was compatible with the system; it was all ok and I was set to present my talk. Having reached early, I got comfortable with the environment and eagerly waited for my talk slot.</p>\n<p>I gave my talk and had a good Q and A for my talk; which gave me the assurance and satisfaction that I presented well and attendees were listening keenly.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing experience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Considering events, workshops, tech talks, conferences I have spoken at about 30-40; including a few virtual speaking engagements.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I attend the talk before my talk to set into the energy of the conference hall. <strong>I also do a demo practice with a friend to gain feedback.</strong></p>\n<p>I feel enthusiastic over nervous before my talk. I believe I have learned to convert my nervous energy into enthusiasm by practicing before my talk. I know it can be difficult due to packed schedules of the conference and work; but I do make sure to make time to practice. Sometimes I skim through my talk contents or rehearse the complete talk depending on the time I can make in my schedule.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I will encourage new speakers to speak about what they are truly passionate about. <strong>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present.</strong> It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!</p>\n<p>If you feel crunching everything you love about the topic into the 30/45 min talk is getting on to you, <strong>go outside and have fresh air. It will help you have a clear head and invoke creativity in your talk.</strong> It is very trivial to know the audience you will be presenting for. Most importantly remember to be yourself and be excited to share with the world what you like about the technology.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I got inspired by the talk by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pranavmistry\">Pranav Mistry</a> on the Sixth-Sense technology. I liked how he presented the technology and included components in the talk that could be understood by someone new in the technology space. It has inspired me to include an overview of concepts related to my topic in the beginning of my talk for a couple of minutes, so that a participant novice to the topic understands the overall picture and doesn’t feel left out.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrtANPtnhyg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>TEDIndia: The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology by Pranav Mistry</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am active on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drishtijjain\">@drishtijjain</a>.

What’s impressive to me is how quickly Kara has embraced her new career and been able to help others by giving talks at conferences and meetups. As Kara points out in this week’s Speaker’s Story, speaking is a great way to bolster your career and encourage others in the field.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into tech and eventually public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zFT1aBg.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I had a weird path to tech. I pursued a career as a professional ballerina for a long time. I even moved to New York City by myself at 17 to train full-time with the Joffrey Ballet School. I really loved ballet but I realized that I’d be lucky if I could make my career last until I was 30 due to all of the strain it puts on your body.</p>\n<p>That’s when I decided to take a break from ballet, move back to my hometown of Nashville, TN, and go to college. I majored in public relations with a music business minor and was one of the lucky few to land a job in the music industry after I graduated.</p>\n<p>I absolutely loved working as a music publicist. It was a very glamorous job but also a highly stressful one and I was getting burnt out pretty quickly. I knew I needed a change and started looking into other career paths when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">CodeCademy</a>. I really enjoyed the feeling of solving an error and decided that I wanted to make the leap to tech so I enrolled in The Iron Yard’s front end engineering bootcamp. Fast forward almost three years later and I’m still loving life in the tech world. I’m currently working as an engineer on the UX team at <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\">CrowdStrike</a>.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely benefited my career. It’s allowed me to expand my network in ways that I’ve never imagined before!</p>\n<p>I got into conference speaking first by writing blog posts which eventually led to speaking at local meetups and then conferences. I like that by speaking at conferences I can help others learn. <strong>It’s really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I’m talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn’t before.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I gave my first conference talk not too long ago! Big shout out to CodeStock for allowing me the opportunity. I’m really happy with the way my talk turned out. I talk fast naturally and talk even faster when I’m nervous so I was worried that my 60-minute time slot would end up being closer to 20 minutes. I took my time and a couple deep breaths and managed to use up most of my allotted time though!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’m still pretty new to the speaker circuit so I’ve only applied to around eight conferences. I’ve spoken at one so far and am currently on the waitlist for another. <strong>I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. I’m learning from each rejection I get.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don’t like to attend a session before my talk as I like to take that time to be by myself and compose my thoughts. I’ll typically run through my slides one last time but I’ll only do a visual run through - I won’t actually practice. I also like to take a minute or two to go somewhere on my own and give myself a little pep talk!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Go for it! You can never succeed if you don’t try.</strong> Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and don’t give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really love watching Chloe Condon’s talks. I love how she injects humor into them.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n3GHyWTaM8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Chloe Condon at DevXcon, 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

Like many speakers, George is an experienced software developer who’s passionate about mentoring and teaching newcomers to the field. In this week’s interview, hear more about how speaking at over 20 conferences so far has helped take George’s career to the next level.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://georgemandis.s3.amazonaws.com/holyjs-piter-2017/me-holy-js.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">George Mandis</a>. I’m currently a full stack, independent web developer at <a href=\"https://snaptortoise.com/\">SnapTortoise</a> based out of Portland, Oregon, though I wear quite a few other hats. I’ve been freelancing for 13 years, but over the past 4 or 5 years I’ve gravitated towards mentorship roles. Teaching classes, workshops, leading bootcamps and working with junior developers one-on-one has been a rewarding experience and speaking feels like a natural extension to this.</p>\n<p>My first foray into speaking was actually at an Ignite event in Portland where I summarized, in 5 minutes, my experience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2QC43jwPyM\">living as a digital nomad</a> for a year. I was terrified to speak in front of so many people, but it went well! After that I though I should look into conference speaking as a way to advance myself professionally, extend the aforementioned mentoring activities I mentioned and continue to travel and see the world, which is one my biggest passions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2QC43jwPyM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things — not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!</strong></p>\n<p>It’s always interesting to me to see one type of work or technology in-demand in one place and find it barely mentioned at all in another. It’s also nice to humanize other developers and put a face and a personality to a name. These conferences also have a tendency to be expensive and difficult to otherwise attend, as an independent developer. Being able to attend these conferences and pick the brain of people who work at some very large, influential tech companies is a wonderful opportunity.</p>\n<p>I think the process of preparing a talk and speaking in front of a large group people could benefit anyone’s career, but for mine it’s certainly opened some doors. <strong>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.</strong></p>\n<p>The other benefit of speaking is I’ve found it’s a great opportunity to talk about the things you want to be doing, even if it’s not the thing you’re necessarily doing in your day-to-day. My talks tend to focus on creativity, art, hardware-dabbling and making interesting, outside-the-box projects through JavaScript. Speaking on these topics has allowed me to spend more time immersed in that world and meet other like-minded and very talented people with similar interests.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My very first “talk” was the 5-minute Ignite talk I mentioned earlier, but my first <em>technical</em> talk was at HolyJS in Russia. I remember applying to a number of conferences by that point in the year. Some had accepted me but had no budget for travel, but HolyJS was the first one where everything lined up.</p>\n<p>The idea of talking for a full hour was incredibly daunting — I’d never done that before! When I pulled up the conference website I became even more nervous — David Crockford and Lea Verou were two developers I’d read and followed for most of my career, and they were head-lining the conference! My attitude going in was, <strong>if this goes terribly, at least I’m 2000 miles from home and probably won’t ever run into any of these people again.</strong> It sounds funny, but it really took the pressure off!</p>\n<p>Fortunately it went well, and I’m happy to say I’ve seen several familiar faces from that conference at other conferences since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’m not sure I could put a number on the number I’ve applied to. I’ve spoken at something around 20 now, but can guarantee you <strong>my acceptance rate is in the single digits, percentage-wise.</strong> Like most opportunities, it really is a numbers game. You have to be diligent and persistent, but also mindful of how you might be able to tweak your proposals to better suit a particular conference’s theme.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>If I have time a day or two before the conference <strong>I like to walk to the venue from wherever I’m staying so that I’m not thinking too hard about finding it on the day I present.</strong> In the hours leading up to the presentation I practice saying key sentences and takeaways for specific slides as I go through the slide from beginning to end, over and over, and make sure all my demos work. Once it’s about 30-minutes or so to go I’ll put the slides away and just try to clear my head. This routine changes depending on how new the talk is and how comfortable I’m feeling with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I also try to see as many other talks as I can</strong>, though I that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming. After I’ve given my talk I’m much more relaxed and find it easier to enjoy the other talks. I try to make a point of shaking hands with all the speakers I see and letting them know I really appreciated what they spoke on. Other speakers might have differing opinions on that, but I know I genuinely appreciate it when someone in the audience comes up to me just to let me know they enjoyed my talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>When it comes to applying <strong>it really is a numbers game.</strong></p>\n<p>Apply early and often and try not to get too down on yourself if your talk isn’t accepted. For topics, there are many schools of thought on this, but I personally feel sharing a case study or story about how you used a particular piece of technology to achieve a specific goal is a good approach for giving your talk structure. Talking about why technology X is cool in general way can be just fine, but sharing how we used X at Y to achieve Z gives the audience something more concrete to walk away with.</p>\n<p>If you’re giving a workshop you can dive more deeply into the nitty-gritty workings of a thing and keep your focus there, but in a 20-40 minutes talk it’s more about introducing an idea and making the case for why others should have interest in it.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are quite a few, but I’ll mention two people I met at my very first talk who I think are wonderful: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/g33konaut\">Martin Splitt</a>. The list could be much longer, but I’ll stick with those for fear of omitting someone! I feel both of them have real passion for the web as an open platform and convey their enthusiasm and knowledge very well when they speak.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>Next, I’ll be giving a talk called <a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2019\">“Hacking Hardware with JavaScript” at Teardown 2019 in Portland, Oregon</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about me, my projects, writing and where I’m speaking next on my website: <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">george.mand.is</a> and follow me on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgeMandis\">@georgeMandis</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: George Mandis, Digital Nomad and Web Developer","path":"/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/06/08","image":"https://georgemandis.s3.amazonaws.com/holyjs-piter-2017/me-holy-js.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GLa6cwP.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I’m a software engineer from Kansas City, Missouri. I love to tech, and I love to share the cool things I’ve learned with other people.</p>\n<p>I have always enjoyed going to schools to speak to students, but I was intrigued by conference speaking. One fateful evening I told <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a>, founder of Kansas City Women in Technology, that I was interested in speaking at tech conferences. She volunteered to be my mentor, set me up with resources for writing abstracts, and she sent me links to open CFPs for various conferences for me to begin submitting those abstracts. It felt like a whirlwind of events…I was writing abstracts the first week of December 2018, submitting those to conferences within the next week, and I got my first acceptance in January!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I’m providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.</p>\n<p>I do believe it has benefited my career, and it has helped me to shine a light on the things I believe are great.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference was DevFest KC this past February in Kansas City. <strong>I was super nervous, and I told the audience this was my first time speaking at a conference. I’m used to trying to engage small groups of teenagers, not 20-40 adults.</strong> However, I needn’t have worried so much. My audience was engaged, they asked questions, and they were eager to participate. By the end of the talk, they didn’t believe that was my first time.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312227563\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          \n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/312227563\">Rhia Dixon at the KC Women in Technology 2019 Kickoff</a></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>At the time of this response, I have applied to 28 conferences. Thus far, I have been accepted to speak at 6 of the 16 conferences that have announced their speakers (1 of which I’ve already done).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine consists of taking one last look at my slides, a few deep breaths, and listening to whatever song that currently has my ears hostage (typically something upbeat and relatively positive with great musicality).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I would pass on some of the best advice I’ve received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a topic that you wouldn’t mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.</li>\n<li>Write your abstract in such a way that the reader gets a pretty good understanding of why they should be at your talk and what they will get from attending.</li>\n<li>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you’ve got friends in the audience — some you may know, and some you may not know…yet.</li>\n<li>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts — <strong>I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.</strong> I’ve found this particularly helpful for tweaking my abstracts and tailoring my talks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Oh, I have plenty! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a> is one of my favorites — I know her, she’s relatable, she doesn’t take herself too seriously, and she has a ball on stage sharing what she knows. I’m also inspired by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techgirl1908\">Angie Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrShirleyDavis\">Dr. Shirley Davis</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxfoundation/44425350705/in/faves-17844497@N00/\" title=\"1E6A7337_Web\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/1958/44425350705_260783ba05_z.jpg\" width=\"427\" height=\"640\" alt=\"1E6A7337_Web\" class=\"left\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>I’m John Riviello and I’ve been working as a frontend web developer for over 20 years. I currently work at Comcast where I am the lead web developer for xFi. My first public presentation was at a Sass meetup in Philadelphia in 2012 where I volunteered to talk about a new open source project I was working on. From there I spoke at a few “unconferences” &#x26; “unconference tracks” at other conferences (where basically as long as you show up and there’s an open speaking slot, it’s yours) before I was first accepted to speak at a conference.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxfoundation/44425350705/in/faves-17844497@N00/\">The Linux Foundation, some rights reserved</a></em></p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The thing I enjoy the most is sharing my experiences, both on stage and in the conversations with attendees afterwards. It has also allowed me to travel to some fun and interesting places.</p>\n<p>There are a couple areas where it has directly benefited my career. <strong>I was given the opportunity to <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Sass-Converting-Existing-Site/434463-2.html\">create a course for Lynda.com</a> because I met Lynda.com staff author <a href=\"http://www.raybo.org/\">Ray Villalobos</a> after we both spoke at a conference.</strong> It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray. In addition, at my current role at Comcast I am expected to be having an impact outside of the company, and public speaking is the path I’ve been leaning on to accomplish that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I was accepted to speak at via a CFP was the University of Illinois Web Conference in 2015. When I talked to folks that attended afterwards, everyone had good things to say, but given it was my first talk I essentially took that as I did not too anything terribly wrong, which was a great first step.</p>\n<p>My favorite talk I’ve given so far is “The Critical Career Path Conversation” which I premiered at The Lead Developer NYC in 2018. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLBzScQzZ83I8H8_0Qete6Bs5EcW3p0kZF&#x26;v=hMz6QDURQOM\">view it on YouTube</a>, including a fun glitch about one-third of the way through for you all to enjoy watching me struggle &#x26; recover from.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMz6QDURQOM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve applied to about 70 so far and spoken at 20.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but I wouldn’t recommend it 😜.</p>\n<p>I usually spend the hour before looking and my slide notes one last time and inevitably tweak a few things here or there. My system is to write out what I’m planning to say for each slide in the slide notes but then I rarely ever follow it directly once I start talking. It’s just a comfort feeling knowing that if I totally forget what I was going to say, the script is there.</p>\n<p>The last thing I do, which I do recommend, is to <strong>make sure you start off smiling</strong> 😃.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is so much I could say here but I’ll limit it to a few quick hits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Imposter syndrome is real and a totally normal feeling</strong>, so do not let that hold you back. Especially early on, I always had a feeling of “everyone in the audience will already know what I’m talking about.” That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During the intro of your talk, let the audience know how you intend to take questions (raise your hand during the talk, hold them until the end, chat in the hallway later, email, etc.). If someone asks a question that you don’t know the answer to, it is much better to say “That is a great question. I don’t know what the answer is so let me get back to you,” than to try to make up an answer on the spot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My CFP acceptance rate went up when I internalized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344\">this piece of advice from Fluent organizer Kyle Simpson</a>:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/advice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#advice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/designingATalk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#designingATalk</a><br><br>OK talks are about the topic.<br><br>Good talks are about the speaker/presentation.<br><br>Great talks are about the audience.</p>&mdash; getify (@getify) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are 2 in particular that I look up to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://meowni.ca/\">Monica Dinculescu</a> because when it comes to technical knowledge, she does an excellent job of taking a topic and distilling it down so that the audience can understand it and apply it immediately. She is able to do it while keeping her talk entertaining with healthy doses of humor and emojis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agiledeveloper.com/\">Venkat Subramaniam</a> is a marathon speaker that I am amazed by. He is a superhuman when it comes to learning new content and teaching it. At the last conference I spoke at, Venkat delivered a full day workshop on the first day and then gave a talk at literally every possible speaking slot over the course of the next 3 days, which totaled 13 separate 90 minute talks. The thing that amazes me even more (especially given my typical pre-talk routine) is he has no slides. He starts off each talk with some bullet point topics in a text editor and the magic happens from there.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>I tweet infrequently at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnriv?lang=en\">@JohnRiv</a>. In the middle of July I’ll be at <a href=\"https://uberconf.com\">ÜberConf</a> in Denver running a full-day workshop on Web Components and giving a couple talks in the days that follow.

Jaime has spoken at a lot of conferences, but like many of us, he’s applied at an order of magnitude more. Read on to learn more about his process and some of his suggestions for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ozbikNQ.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I’m Jaime Lopez Jr and I’m a software developer by day and a podcaster by night.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking because I wanted to reach a new audience where I could share my knowledge, experiences, and stories. I’ve co-hosted a podcast (<a href=\"https://mtjc.fireside.fm/\">More Than Just Code</a>) for the past 4-5 years, so public speaking was a natural extension of that experience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like being able to share things that I have learned because I hope that my experiences can be helpful to others who encounter the same struggles that I have encountered.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has benefited my career by providing an opportunity to meet other people in the industry that I wouldn’t ordinarily get a chance to meet!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first conference talk. I co-presented a talk at 360iDev in Denver, Colorado with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timmitra\">Tim Mitra</a> (my friend and a co-host of More Than Just Code).</p>\n<p>The talk went very well from what I recall. The topic was about the way that hosting a technical podcast can help developers in their careers, which plays to our strengths as experienced podcasters. Of course it also helped that we had a few die-hard fans in the audience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Looking at my Google Sheets spreadsheet where I track this, I’ve applied to about <strong>115 conferences in the past three years or so</strong>. I’ve been accepted by 14 conferences and have spoken at (or am scheduled to speak at) 9 of those conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I like to find a quiet place to collect my thoughts about an hour prior to when I give my presentation. It certainly helps when there is a dedicated room for speakers to do this! Also, if possible I try to check out the room where I’ll be speaking so I can get a sense of the acoustics as well as how the audience will experience the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>I generally try not to memorize my talks because it causes me to become robotic when speaking</strong>. Instead, I walk through the main points (generally a single word) that I want to mention related to my slides or code that I’m sharing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is one main piece of advice that I can give new speakers:</p>\n<p><strong>It is usually difficult to get started as a conference speaker in terms of getting your CFP submissions accepted. This is totally okay and you don’t need to worry about it!</strong></p>\n<p>I subscribed to the (now-defunct) <a href=\"https://techspeak.email/\">Technically Speaking newsletter</a> that was put together by Chiu-Ki Chan and Cate Huston. The content in that newsletter (which is still available online) helped me craft my CFP submissions so that there is a better chance of being accepted. As well, the Technically Speaking newsletter helped me feel better about CFP acceptance rates (which if I recall they said was somewhere about 10%).</p>\n<p>If I’ve learned anything over the past few years of submitting to CFPs, <strong>it’s that it is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference</strong> (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP).</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers that come to mind.</p>\n<p>First is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/savinola\">Laura Savino</a>. The way she gives technical presentations makes the audience feel as if they’re going along on a shared journey. Each step of the way seems like a friend is sharing their favorite locations in an unfamiliar city.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkb9z68nhyo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Readable Code - Laura Savino - DDD Europe 2018</em></p>\n<p>Second is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nickolas Means</a>. I’ve been impressed with the way that he can smoothly deliver stories that involve a lot of technical detail. The way he presents the topics at hand leaves the audience on the edge of their seat.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BkjG0j1.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I don’t remember exactly how or why I first got into public speaking. I believe my first tech talks were at small user groups in the Grand Rapids, Michigan tech community around 2010 or so. From there I got into guesting on podcasts, then hosting my own podcast, and then speaking at conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I have an altruistic reason and a selfish reason for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<p>The altruistic reason is that I can help a lot of people by speaking at conferences and sharing my message with attendees.</p>\n<p>The selfish reason is that speaking at conferences is a good way to boost my career prospects as a technology consultant. Since I’ve only started speaking at conferences about six months ago, I think it’s too early to expect to see any tangible benefit from it yet. One way conference speaking has intangibly benefited me though is that I can now list in my bio that I’ve spoken at certain conferences like RubyConf India which I think carries a lot of weight among my peers, and I can truthfully say that I’m an “international speaker”.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at a regional conference called DevOpsDays Midwest in St. Louis, Missouri in September 2018. Since I had already been speaking at local user groups for years before that point, this speaking gig didn’t feel like too big of a jump up. I’m happy to say that as far as I can tell, the talk went fine.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve applied to many dozens of conferences. I’ve spoken at five conferences at the time of this interview with two more conference talks coming up, for a total of seven. I’ve been accepted to more conferences than that but sometimes I can’t go because there’s a schedule conflict or the travel expense is too much to justify at the time.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don’t have a pre-talk routine. I rehearse beforehand but on the day of the talk I just get up and do it.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I only have one piece of advice: If getting a talk proposal accepted seems like an unattainable goal, just keep sending in proposals and you’ll probably eventually get something accepted.</p>\n<p>I had to submit dozens of proposals before I finally got a talk accepted, at least a talk at a conference I was able to attend. At this point I’ve actually gotten more talks accepted than I can take on and I’ve had to throttle back on sending in proposals. The act of giving my first talk gave me a couple ideas for my next talk. My next talk gave me several more ideas for future talks, and so on. The more I submitted proposals and the more I spoke, the easier it all got.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I think part of my motivation for speaking at conferences was seeing the success that my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlainChautard\">Alain Chautard</a> has had with it and seeing the impact speaking has had on his consulting career.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJwvmuK4tQw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alain Chautard at NG Conf 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

I’ve seen several of\nKeanan’s talks including one about Alexa and another about serverless functions in PHP. Keanan also has an entrepreneurial\nspirit, which I appreciate, so it was great to learn more about his experience speaking.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mcsi3b6.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi I’m Keanan and I’m a developer-turned-CTO and I co-founded <a href=\"https://alphaparticle.com/\">Alpha Particle</a>, a digital consultancy in Chicago. I got into public speaking at one of my previous jobs when we decided that our company should get more involved in the development community. So I started reading up on exactly how conferences decided on talks and started submitting to CFPs!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy all the people I’ve been able to meet as a result of the speaking that I’ve done. <strong>I especially enjoy chatting with people at the speaker dinners or other informal events surrounding the conference.</strong> As far as benefits to my career, some of these connections I’ve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs, new clients and even (arguably) this interview.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at WordCamp Nashville in 2016. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/03/17/keanan-koppenhaver-take-wp-admin-to-the-next-level-with-advanced-custom-fields/\">video is actually online</a>, though I cringe watching it. It was a 20 minute “lightning talk” and I remember having to follow an awesome speaker who had the audience on the edge of their seat the entire time. The majority of my talk actually went well, but near the end (~14:00) you can see my heart jump up into my throat when one of my demos didn’t work correctly! Luckily, I was able to fix it and finish the talk, and <strong>this definitely wasn’t the last time demos didn’t work exactly right</strong>.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Between conferences and meetups, I’ve probably spoken at between 20-30 and applied to probably twice that many. I don’t really apply to conferences that I don’t feel like I’d be a great fit for, but even then sometimes they just really can’t take everybody.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><em>Cue Eye of the Tiger montage…</em></p>\n<p>But seriously, I usually just try to get into the room I’ll be speaking in before I have to give my talk (either by getting to the conference early in the morning or during lunch) and make sure my computer can interface with the projector and that the fonts on my slides are readable even in the back of the room.</p>\n<p><strong>I always try to attend the talk before mine in the same room</strong>, just so I can start setting up and doing a final check of everything as soon as the last presenter is done with their talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think there’s definitely lots of feelings from new speakers around not being knowledgeable enough to start speaking. <strong>But if a conference was only filled with super-advanced talks, they would lose a huge part of their audience.</strong> So, even if you just learned something, you can teach it and many attendees will welcome your perspective as a relatively-recent beginner. <strong>Since you just went through it all for the first time yourself, you know and remember all the roadblocks that someone getting started will have and can help them learn even quicker.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to that, the one thing that started really getting me more speaking opportunities is <strong>submitting multiple talks to each CFP</strong>. Conference organizers sometimes have an agenda of the talks they’re looking to accept and if you submit more talks, you give them more chances to fit you into the schedule they’re looking to craft. (However, some conferences specifically say to not submit more than X talks, so definitely abide by that.)</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>I was probably a year into speaking at conferences before I heard about “developer relations” (also called “DevRel”).\nIt’s a relatively new field that blends software development and marketing, so many conference speakers get into DevRel (and vice-versa).\nThis week’s featured speaker, Alex Lakatos runs a great newsletter for developer relations professionals\ncalled <a href=\"https://developeravocados.net/\">Developer Avocados 🥑 Weekly</a>. In addition to that, he has a fantastic story about\nhow he accidentally fell into speaking, so read on to learn more about Alex and his tips for technical speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FDVubKV.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>About 8 years ago, I was a JavaScript Test Developer working for an outsourcer in Romania (I happen to be Romanian), contracting for Mozilla. A friend was organizing this conference called Open Source Open Mind and wanted someone from our team to come to speak about Mozilla and how to get involved. I was terrified of public speaking, but luckily one of my coworkers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ioana_cis\">Ioana</a>, said she’d do it. Ioana was in the US at a client on-site just before the conference though, so she asked me to do the slides for her. Naively, I accepted, thinking there’s no harm in it and it’s the least I could do since she was getting me out of having to be on stage.</p>\n<p>The day of the conference rolls around, and we’re all in the airport early in the morning, waiting for Ioana’s flight to land. Just as the airport was listing her flight as “Cancelled”, we got a message from Ioana to go ahead to the conference, and stall as much as possible, she’ll be on the next flight and should be there in time for the last slot of the day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pensacolla\">Marcela</a>, the conference organizer, being a friend, kept pushing Ioana’s talk further in the schedule. But the last talk of the day comes up, and Ioana is nowhere to be found. So Marcela goes up on stage and looks panicked at the audience, sees me in the front row, and just blurts out: “And now, talking about the Mozilla community…Alex is going to talk about the Mozilla community!“.</p>\n<p>I was dumbstruck, I got on stage and I just sat there quietly for about a minute. And then I started talking and didn’t stop until the Q&#x26;A part. It was horrible, I had my hands in my pocket the entire time, I made a bunch of rookie mistakes. There is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMnwjpy_3J0\">video of it</a> somewhere on youtube, luckily in Romanian, so not very popular. To this day I still use it as an example of ‘what not to do’ during my public speaking training. 😅</p>\n<p>When the Q&#x26;A part came, people were a bit on edge, and every time someone bashed Firefox with their questions, I took a step into the audience. I think I finished the Q&#x26;A part literally in the middle of the audience, and trying to make a step to my left to go towards the last person that asked a question. That’s when I realized maybe it was time to end the talk, well over my allotted time slot.</p>\n<p>That’s how I started speaking in public. A few weeks after that I was MCing one of the community events we had going, someone from the Mozilla Community team saw me and decided that’s what I was going to do moving forward. I got tons of mentorship from the Mozilla people, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a>, as I was starting out and it just encouraged me to get better and be on stage more often than in the audience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The reason I speak at conferences is simple. I feel guilty about being privileged enough to have gone to a Computer Science University, so <strong>I try as much as possible to help other people get into tech, or get better at tech</strong>. Knowing I helped at least one person by being on stage and sharing my knowledge makes me feel a bit better about that.</p>\n<p>I used to think public speaking was making me a better communicator, so it was helping me indirectly in my career as a JavaScript Developer. But about two years ago I got a job as a JavaScript Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://developer.nexmo.com/team\">Nexmo</a>, and my community work and public speaking was the reason I got the job. So it helped me directly in my career, to the point its part of my day to day work! 😅</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mWBqS30hoI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alex Lakatos at View Source</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don’t really have an exact number, but let’s go with “a lot”. For context, last year I’ve either spoken, attended, hosted or sponsored 40 events (not just conferences, but smaller meetups as well). If I had to venture a guess based on my slides repo on Github, I’d say <strong>I spoke at around 50 conferences and meetups so far</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, and it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. <strong>I get so nervous before going on stage that I can’t eat, drink or interact with people.</strong> There is this Psychology of Winning that tells you how to get into a winner mindset, and that calms down my nerves enough to get on stage and start talking. After the first minute or so practice takes over and I actually enjoy being on stage but let me tell you about getting there.</p>\n<p><strong>I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won</strong> (dunno what, but the point is I’m a winner now!): pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few “Hell yeah!“s if I think the toilet it empty (spoiler alert: it rarely is as empty as I think). That makes me think I just won something, I don’t need to win on stage as well, and it calms my nerves enough so I don’t shake as I speak.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There are so many things I can list, it’ll just end up being another blog post just for this question. I think there are a lot more resources out there now compared to when I started, so <strong>my advice is just “practice”. No one did great the first time they got on stage or the second one, but practice makes perfect.</strong> So look at your presentations, identify the areas you could have done better (be it slides, content, posture, delivery), and then find the next conference or meetup where you can practice your talk some more and improve on those points.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for resources on public speaking or want to take the plunge and become a Developer Advocate, I co-curated this newsletter called “Developer Avocados 🥑 Weekly”. If you <a href=\"http://developeravocados.net/\">subscribe</a>, you get a bunch of highly curated articles from the past week in your inbox every Monday, along with a few conferences CFPs that support speakers with travel and accommodation.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>When I started out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/codepo8\">Chris Heilmann</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertnyman\">Robert Nyman</a> helped me and inspired me a lot.</p>\n<p>Today, I think one of my favorite speakers is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simona_cotin/\">Simona Cotin</a>. I like her Serverless talks a lot, the live coding with a fallback to recordings is something I keep telling people they should do more of in their talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTrHSQbxR-Y' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Simona Cotin at JAMStack</em>conf 2018_</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>I hang out on Twitter these days, so <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lakatos88\">follow me there</a>. I’m hoping my next talk is going to be JSUnconf, but it is an unconference so it’s a bit uncertain. My next confirmed talk is going to be the International JavaScript Conference in London.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Alex Lakatos of Developer Avocados 🥑 Weekly","path":"/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/04/27","image":"https://i.imgur.com/FDVubKV.png"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests. At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Joe and I are both from Chicago, so we’ve known each other for a few years. One thing I really admire about Joe is his eagerness to help new developers find their way in our industry. While we didn’t talk about it in this interview, he runs <a href=\"http://chicagoapprenticeships.com/\">Chicago Apprenticeships</a>, a site dedicated to helping bootcamp graduates find their first development job.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>I’ve always looked at Joe as someone who really knows his stuff, so it was interesting to me to hear that Joe still struggles with nerves when he’s speaking. Remember, people may look like they’ve got it all together on the outside, and still be nervous!</p>\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pUB2xtQ.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I’m Joe! I’ve been in tech for a very long time, and giving talks at conferences for maybe five years. I’m very much a generalist, so I take a lot of different roles in tech. Overall, though, I’d say I’ve been most interested in making teams more effective lately.</p>\n<p><strong>I was originally on the fence about whether I should give a talk. Too nervous.</strong> While grabbing drinks with someone much more experienced than myself, she basically told me to get over it and just apply. That turned out to be great advice. Since then I’ve given a ton of talks, both soft topics and purely technical ones.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>I’ve been incredibly fortunate to get to meet and become friends with some of my heroes in the industry as a result of speaking at conferences.</strong> That’s probably the biggest benefit for me. The Ruby community — where I give most of my talks — is full of supportive, brilliant folks, so that’s really made me feel good about participating.</p>\n<p>It’s definitely impacted my career. <strong>I still get folks coming to talk to me about talks I gave a few years ago.</strong> I can point to videos of my talks when talking to companies or folks inside my own company. And it let me sharpen my own thinking and discussion skills around tech topics. It’s been a huge boon.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFuzIWz6Ynk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Joe speaking at Rails Conf, 2017</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Honestly I don’t think I slept for three days before my first talk. One of the reasons I enjoy giving talks is that I get to work on my fear of speaking in front of crowds. That said, <strong>I always struggle right before I actually get on stage.</strong> I was at a single track conference in a theatre auditorium, which made me feel even more nervous.</p>\n<p>But once I was on stage, I was able to get into a rhythm and really get across the ideas I wanted to convey. And at some point I remembered that I do know and care about my topic deeply. That gave me a lot of confidence. I’d say it was a success.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve applied to a few dozen. I’ve been accepted at maybe a quarter of those that I applied to? <strong>I have a much easier time getting accepted at regional and US-based conferences.</strong> I’d really like to do more international speaking, but I think I probably need to have more visibility domestically and focus more on that goal before it’ll happen. I’m also much more comfortable in communities that I feel attached to (Ruby) than general programming conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Panic? Honestly, I usually spend the morning of a talk walking back and forth clicking through my slides and making sure that I have the major points from that slide down cold. I’ve never been good at preparing to the point where I’ve got my entire talk scripted, so that’s helpful for me as a routine.</p>\n<p>I probably should script my entire talks, but that’s not really my speed.</p>\n<p><strong>I do wear the same t-shirt nearly every time I give a talk. That’s pretty much a ritual at this point.</strong></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Ignore the fear and just apply.</strong></p>\n<p>I can totally understand the impostor syndrome, it’s hard to make the transition from an audience member to a speaker. It’s a bit cliche, but I do try to help new speakers remember that <strong>the things that they learned in the past year are totally new material to others</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>I’d definitely recommend taking advantage of any speaker help that conferences offer.</strong> It’s a huge boon to get people to listen to your talk ahead of time. There are also lots of articles out there on how to write a good proposal. Overall, let other peoples’ hard won wisdom get you through the early parts.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’ve had the fortune or misfortune to speak on the same stage as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sandimetz\">Sandi Metz</a> before. The clarity of how she conveys deep technical ideas always blows my mind. She’s definitely the person whose style I’d like to get better at emulating. If I would just start scripting my talks.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzWLGMtXflg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Sandi Metz at RubyConf 2017</em></p>\n<p>That said, there are plenty of other speakers with really different styles who all convey ideas really effectively, in really different ways. Say, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nick Means</a> versus <a href=\"https://twitter.com/searls\">Justin Searls</a>. You can’t take someone else’s voice, and you don’t need to.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>No conferences on the books now as I’m adjusting to a new job and hoping to take advantage of being in a company to get more opportunity to give talks. Hopefully this next CFP season I’ll be back on the trail.</p>\n<p>Until then I’m at <a href=\"http://josephmastey.com/\">josephmastey.com</a>, <a href=\"http://chicagoapprenticeships.com/\">chicagoapprenticeships.com</a>, or on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmmastey\">@jmmastey</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RSeC2VQ.jpg\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Joe Mastey, Tech Generalist and Apprenticeship Advocate","path":"/blog/speakers-story-joe-mastey/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/04/21","image":"https://i.imgur.com/JPkvp6S.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests. At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>After being reluctant (and admittedly nervous) to get on stage as a speaker, Nicola was finally\nconvinced that her experience was worth sharing. Her story is inspiring, because as Nicola points\nout, there aren’t a ton of speakers like her (Australian, female designers) out there.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m an independent product design consultant, working with software teams on their research and design as well as their process. I’m Australian, but I travel around a lot now days.</p>\n<p>I really had to force myself into public speaking. <strong>I was that girl who was so nervous I felt sick when I had to answer a question in class in front of people in high school.</strong> I was so shy and scared of public speaking. I never, ever thought I’d be speaking at conferences one day.</p>\n<p>I was lucky later on that I had a manager (Lawrence Crowther) who kept suggesting I give a talk. I think the fact that he saw me as someone who should be on stage was what I needed to feel like I could do it. Then the guy who runs Web Directions in Sydney reached out to me on Twitter after some blog posts I wrote, and specifically said he’d love to see my application to speak at the conference coming up. They promised speaker training for anyone who wanted it, so I went ahead and applied. Lo and behold, I was accepted… So then I had to force myself to get comfortable with public speaking in a matter of a few months.</p>\n<p>I really appreciate both of these people for believing I was the right person to be on stage, and encouraging me to do it. <strong>I think to get less represented people on stage, we really need to just ask them more.</strong> It’s hard to imagine yourself on stage if you’ve never really seen someone like you doing it. I didn’t feel like I’d seen many young, Aussie, female designers doing talks, so I guess it just didn’t really seem like something I could do.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qTCPnIX.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The two things I’ve spoken about most - retrospectives and collaborative user research - are both things I’m really passionate about. So it’s just exciting to be able to share information I really think people should have.</p>\n<p>On a more selfish level, <strong>its great to be able to speak about the thing you’re interested in in front of a lot of people, because it means for the rest of the conference the other people who share your passion will come up and talk to you.</strong> I’ve met some really interesting people. And having spoken about your field at conferences gives you a little boost of initial authority on the subject that you otherwise have to build from scratch every time you meet a new client.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I tested out that my laptop connection and slides were working so many times in the break before my talk that they had to shoo me off stage. And still, the connection totally failed when I got up there in front of 800 people. The AV guy had to actually restart my computer on stage while I was standing there introducing myself at length. Super awkward! But I feel like I swallowed the frog: the possibly worst thing happened the first time. It all had to be uphill from there.</p>\n<p>(For the record, the talk went fine once we got the slides working again!)</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve spoken at 3 conferences, with #4 coming up in June. Two in Sydney one in Kingston, Jamaica (!) and the next in Cornwall in the UK. I’ve applied to a lot more than that!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5mC7jQ3Lto' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Nicola Rushton at WebCraftConf - User Research is for Everyone</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I always try and test out the talk on a real audience or two before the conference.</strong> Whether that’s at a workplace or a Meetup, I always find things to change and get feedback from people. I will practice my talk probably ten or more times in the few weeks before the conference, just in my house talking to the walls!</p>\n<p>Directly on the day of the talk, I don’t have much of a routine. If anyone asks me about how I’m feeling I tell them “excited!” Even if I’m actually totally nervous, I find that embodying excitement helps me feel that way. I normally don’t eat much on the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The most useful thing I have ever been told regarding public speaking was that <strong>the intense rush of adrenaline and nerves before you get on stage is COMPLETELY NORMAL and it happens to everyone, even people who’ve been doing it for years</strong>. In fact, if it stops happening, there’s something wrong. When I felt like that before, I used to get kind of worried and feel like maybe it would cause me to shake or faint on stage or something. But now I just observe that feeling and think to myself, awesome. My body is giving me all the adrenaline and hormones to do an awesome job of this. And I know it doesn’t come across on stage (especially if you smile!)</p>\n<p><strong>Think about starting by talking at Meetups, being on panels, or even hosting a Meetup.</strong> Smaller moments of being on stage helped me feel comfortable building up to standing up and speaking for 45 minutes straight.</p>\n<p>I think it’s also worth saying that representation on stage can be really useful for other people in the audience. Seeing people like you doing things can make someone reconsider whether they might be the right person to do that thing too. <strong>Just by being up there and being yourself you could be encouraging someone else to get up and share the thing they’re passionate about too.</strong> I find this perspective valuable if I start to feel imposter syndrome.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>One of the most useful things I did for myself when forcing myself to become comfortable with public speaking was to <strong>hold myself to a low standard</strong>.</p>\n<p>That might sound really counterintuitive, but I just told myself at the start that if I got on stage, said everything I wanted to say, and didn’t trip over myself, then it would be a huge success. Then the next time, I pushed myself to do all of that and one more thing. Then the next time, just a tiny bit better. This allowed me to always feel REALLY positive and successful and happy about my public speaking. I didn’t want to get into feeling like I didn’t do good enough, and become discouraged. So really, my goal is to just be myself on stage, have good content, and communicate what I want to communicate in an engaging way.</p>\n<p>I don’t compare myself to anyone else!</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://nicolarushton.com/\">www.nicolarushton.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicolarushton\">Nicola on Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/nicola-rushton/\">Nicola on Linkedin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My next conference talk is in <a href=\"https://agileonthebeach.com/sessions/2019/bring-the-team-along-for-the-ride-why-products-are-better-when-agile-teams-do-research-together/\">June at Agile on the Beach, UK</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Nicola Rushton, Overcoming Reluctance to Share Her Passion","path":"/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/04/12","image":"https://i.imgur.com/qTCPnIX.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

Nobody cared, but it was fun.</p>\n<p>Pretty quickly however, I got more into server-side software engineering with Java/J2EE, then PHP and C#/.Net, where I developed a better understanding of Object-Oriented Design, Database Design and Information Security.</p>\n<p>I’ve been managing engineering organizations of various sizes since 2007, and to this day, remain close to the code, seeking out every opportunity to coach software engineers toward successful careers.</p>\n<p>Having learned many lessons “the hard way” over the past 20 years, in 2017 I started developing a growing portfolio of talks shining light on various aspects of Software Crafting and InfoSec. Having spoken at various local meetups, I got into my first “full software conference” as a speaker at the 2017 inaugural Coder <a href=\"https://www.codercruise.com\">Cruise Conference</a> by the fine folks at One for All Events. In 2017 I also spoke at a couple of InfoSec conferences by invitation from contacts developed from speaking at local OWASP meetups. All in all, 2017 ignited my speaking career.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eEzegV6.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has been a powerful cathartic outlet for overcoming my ever-growing frustration of seeing software engineers making the same mistakes I did earlier-on in my career.</p>\n<p>Far beyond this however, speaking with attendees and listening to their stories, experiences, frustrations and successes, has also been very rewarding and has often given me ideas for new talks, while helping me refine existing talks. Sharing meals and drinks with attendees is a lot of fun. I do tend to be shy though, so I find it easier to engage with people in more intimate settings. <strong>I make a point of sitting at tables of people I don’t know and listening to their conversations while slowly coming out of my shell.</strong></p>\n<p>I also love meeting and learning from other sharp speakers at conferences. It’s helped me correct misconceptions, learn new things, and think about various problems differently.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting to travel the World has been an unbelievable experience. The people, the sights, the food. Just amazing.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, I absolutely love meeting authors and contributors to open-source projects, with plenty of time to chat with them at speaker dinners and thank them profusely, in person, for their work. I’m also starting to contribute to some projects on Patreon.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first Software Engineering talk lacked structure. I jumped into concepts without sufficiently linking them with a common thread, both with slides and verbally. The audience was very supportive though and in general agreed with my concepts. Questions were thoughtful, and I did get a good amount of spontaneous positive feedback after it, with solid break-out discussions.</p>\n<p>My first InfoSec talk could date as far back as 2015 at a local OWASP Meetup. The graphics in my slides were just too “thin” with insufficient contrast and text that was too small. My delivery wasn’t on-point either. <strong>Despite all that, several people came-up afterward to continue the discussion.</strong></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>In 2018, I started getting accepted to a good number of conferences and spoke at seven of them. In 2019 so-far I’m looking at seven conferences between March and June. I’d be happy to score a couple more for the fall/winter season, but I do have limited availability because speaking at conferences isn’t part of my job description.</p>\n<p>For each conference at which I speak, I take personal time off from work. I also save-up money to bring my Wife to <em>a couple</em> of conferences per year. We strategize about the destinations she’d hope for the most, and when her parents are available to take care of our 2 daughters for a few days.</p>\n<p><strong>I do apply to “several dozen” conferences each year. It’s … overwhelming at times.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go over my slides, rehearse mental timing milestones at various sections of it. In some cases make some last-minute tweaks if I find an opportunity to more closely align an area of the presentation with the conference’s audience. Or something relevant that just happened in the news.</li>\n<li>Try to scope out the room and check for connectivity, HDMI, Power.</li>\n<li>Make sure my laser pointer works.</li>\n<li>Figure out where I can stash a bottle of water near the podium for mid-talk swig.</li>\n<li>Scope out well ahead of my talk, where the Audio/Video engineers are in case I need their help.</li>\n<li>See whether the previous speaker in my room had any issue with the equipment.</li>\n<li>Get laptop, remote and everything set-up at least 10 minutes before my talk, I like to start setting-up 15-20 minutes ahead of time when I can, and be fully-ready at the 10-minute mark. Yea … I’m also the person who shows-up at the airport at least 2 hours before any flight even with CLEAR and Pre-check.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Conferences are literally yearning for new voices. Attendees are growing tired of seeing the same people at conferences year after year.</strong> An increasing number of conferences are focusing their attention on attracting new speakers with no speaking experience with a great emphasis on diversity for underrepresented demographics.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://selfconference.org\">SelfConference.org</a> — Speaking at a conference doesn’t have to be about having mastered technology X or methodology Y. It can be about your journey, your struggles, your learning process. Conference attendees love seeing a person to whom they can relate, sharing their struggles and hearing their story.</p>\n<p>Additionally, some of the most compelling talks and keynotes I’ve watched had nothing to do with technology. They were about human topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re struggling with mental health, become a spokesperson for <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">OSMIHelp.org</a>, and educate us.</li>\n<li>If you’re struggling with discrimination, educate us.</li>\n<li>If you’re struggling with accessibility, educate us.</li>\n<li>If you care about something, educate us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Turn the World into allies for the causes you care about.</strong></p>\n<p>Back to technology though, if you fear “imposter syndrome”, just know that you have valuable experience to share. I use this syndrome as motivation to more thoroughly research topics I speak on, and to seek out prevailing counter arguments to the points I’m about to make.</p>\n<p>With all this said, the most defensible position lies within what has worked for you, from the confines of realities which you had to face.</p>\n<p>Finally, keep in mind that conference organizers and their speaker selection panels know what they’re doing. <strong>If they’ve picked you, it’s important for you to realize that they’ve done their due-diligence, and that you absolutely, positively, unequivocally belong on that stage.</strong></p>\n<p>So what’s the downside to submitting? What’s the worst that can happen? You might unleash your awesomeness unto the World?</p>\n<p>Bring it.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?</h3>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sandimetz.com\">Sandi Metz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/anjanavakil\">Anjana Vakil</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ieatkillerbees\">Samantha Quiñones</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CalEvans\">Cal Evans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonskeet\">Jon Skeet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jenna.io\">Jenna Quindica</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/xiehan\">Nara Kasbergen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docondev.com\">Doc Norton</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eryno\">Eryn O’Neil</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/philsturgeon\">Phil Sturgeon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HMSEvans\">Stephanie Evans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewtrask\">Matthew Trask</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaMauerhan\">Jessica Mauerhan</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/saramg\">Sara Golemon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com\">Scott Wlaschin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanColdwater\">Ian Coldwater</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jbrains.ca\">J.B.

Each week, the CFP Land newsletter contains more than 30 conferences, so it’s really annoying to sift through all of them looking for the few you really care about. For that reason, each email you get now includes a link to “Update Your Preferences”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sp9mq2c.png\" alt=\"Update your preferences in the weekly email\"></p>\n<p>This will take you to form where you can specify the category of conferences you prefer:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iibk8D7.png\" alt=\"Category preference form\"></p>\n<p>Each week, any CFPs matching your preferred category should show up at the top of your email:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3utX9jM.png\" alt=\"Preferred CFPs\"></p>\n<p>Location preferences aren’t quite ready yet, but they will be coming soon!</p>\n<h2>“New” Tags</h2>\n<p>Another way to pick out new CFPs from the weekly email is to focus on any that are new. The list is sorted by CFP end date, so usually new ones will be at the bottom, but occasionally I’ll add a conference CFP just before it closes. In this case, it will show up marked with the ”🔔 New” tag. This means the conference has been added since the last email was sent 7 days ago:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sp9mq2c.png\" alt=\"New tag indicates a conference has been added in the past 7 days\"></p>\n<h2>Perks for Speakers</h2>\n<p>Finally, I’m spending extra time each week looking for the “Perks” that each conference offers to speakers (hopefully I’ll be able to automate this eventually). This was another highly requested feature, and it definitely helps if you’re trying to prioritize conferences that will cover travel or hotel costs for you.</p>\n<p>Right now the perks I look for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Travel</strong> meaning that the conference will pay for your travel to and from the event.</li>\n<li><strong>Hotel</strong> indicates that the conference offers reimbursement for hotel costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Stipend</strong> is an offer for payment or extra cash to cover miscellaneous expenses while speaking. Not many conferences offer this, so it’s nice when they do!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because my resources are limited, I only include these perks when they are <strong>clearly listed</strong> on the conference’s website page for speakers. If I miss something, you can always email me to let me know. Also, I decided not to include whether a free ticket for the event was included because <em>almost</em> every conference includes this by default.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/P03MMW4.png\" alt=\"Perks like travel, hotel, and stipend are included in each email\"></p>\n<p>That’s it for this month’s new features.

In this interview, we cover how she got into speaking at tech\nconferences, her advice for new speakers, and some of the ways speaking has\nbenefited her professionally.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0KSCAln6MEJrW0a3URY6ow.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’ve become a more active speaker at technical conferences just in the last\nyear. Over the past several years, I would speak here and there, generally after\nbeing invited by someone involved with the event. But last year I was looking\ninto conferences I might want to attend for women in tech, and I saw a CFP on\nthe website for one of them. I thought, “Oh, maybe instead of just attending\nthese conferences, I could speak at them,” and I was right!</p>\n<p>I wish I had realized sooner that <strong>you don’t always have to be personally\ninvited to speak at events.</strong> Now that I’m aware of the CFP process, I’m\nspeaking regularly at conferences across the country.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences? Has it benefited your career?</h3>\n<p>I think conferences can be such a fun way to meet people, whether you’re\nspeaking or not. But I have to admit, being a speaker has its perks. There are\ndinners, networking events, sometimes lounges specifically for the speakers,\nwhich build an immediate sense of community. I’ve been blown away by some of the\nother speakers I’ve met in these settings.</p>\n<p>Speaking also establishes your authority in your subject area, and it gives you\nthe chance to genuinely help people learn something new. This teaching aspect is\nespecially important to me, given my background in the education space.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Being in EdTech, I’ve always spoken at events for teachers, which was a natural\nprogression from being in the classroom and participating in or leading\nprofessional development sessions. But my first speaking engagement that was for\nmore of a technical and business-oriented audience was on a panel of EdTech\nentrepreneurs at <a href=\"https://1871.com/\">Chicago’s tech incubator and hub, 1871</a>.\nOne of the organizers had seen me giving a product demo and asked for me to join\nthe event, perhaps to help them avoid the dreaded all-male panel (or “manel”).</p>\n<p>And again, this experience corrected some misconceptions I had about public\nspeaking. I used to think all panelists must be exceptional at coming up with\noff-the-cuff responses to tricky questions on the spot, and maybe some of them\nare, but that’s definitely not the norm.</p>\n<p>In my experience at the 1871’s event, the panelists were all given the questions\nahead of time so we could prepare, and I was asked if I’d be comfortable kicking\nthe panel off by responding to the first question. I didn’t need to worry about\ncoming up with responses in the moment, because I was prepped ahead of time,\nwhich made the experience a lot less intimidating. And the format of a panel —\nbeing seated, one in a row of several speakers — creates a more casual vibe as\nwell. <strong>I’d definitely recommend panels as a gateway experience for anyone who\nis considering branching out into public speaking.</strong></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve spoken at about 10 conferences to date, and I currently have 4 more\nscheduled in the coming months. I don’t keep count on how many I’ve applied to,\nbut it’s been a lot! <strong>I definitely don’t get accepted to every event — I don’t\nthink anyone does.</strong> But I’ve very much enjoyed the conferences I’ve been a part\nof, and I’m looking forward to the ones ahead.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I try to access the room some time before my session to make sure the AV setup\nis good to go, but apart from that, I’m usually attending someone else’s session\nright up until it’s time for mine to start!</p>\n<p>I know not everyone’s schedules allow them to spend the full day at the event,\nbut <strong>I think it’s a shame when speakers come in just for their session and then\nleave.</strong> I make it a point to support and learn from the other speakers when I’m\nat a conference, so my session is usually one of many that I participate in\nthroughout the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>My biggest piece of advice is to just go for it!</p>\n<p>I’m involved in a lot of online communities, and I’ll see people posting in\nSlack, asking if they should respond to a CFP they’re interested in. My response\nis always yes. Why not? <strong>It doesn’t take much to respond to a CFP. You don’t\nhave to have a whole session ready to go. You just need an idea and an\nabstract.</strong></p>\n<p>Think of something you’ve been successful at professionally, and then think of\nwhat advice you’d give to others on that topic. Can you come up with 5–10 tips\nto make your audience better at X? A coding language, a new tool, even a soft\nskill? Then you’ve got enough to respond to a CFP.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of resources on writing strong CFP submissions, so I’d recommend\ndoing a little research in that area, but <strong>don’t be intimidated, especially if\nyou’re a member of an underrepresented group. Conferences need more\nrepresentation of diversity and inclusion.</strong> Go for it!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers who have inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One that comes to mind is Jennifer Wesley at Google, who gave the opening\nremarks at the Women Techmakers Summit in Chicago for International Women’s Day\nrecently. She stands out to me because she was able to get personal on stage,\nand in doing so, she established that the summit was a safe space for women.\n<strong>By being willing to be a little vulnerable with her personal story, she set\nthe tone for the whole day.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/95g2cd8pwe8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Jennifer Wesley at TEDxParker speaking about women in STEM</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I always post about my upcoming sessions on\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LBJanusek\">Twitter</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbjanusek/\">LinkedIn</a>, and I share speaker\ndiscounts there when I can, so follow or connect with me if you’re interested.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Laura Janusek, Chief Product Officer in Educational Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/03/31","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0KSCAln6MEJrW0a3URY6ow.jpeg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

One of the things I love about speaking at conferences is the\nopportunity to meet people from all over the world, so reading Geshan’s\nexperience as a speaker on multiple continents was inspiring.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*mQ216JZETiJBtVpHdGLBkA.jpeg\" class=\"left\">\n<h3>Tell me about yourself? How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I have been a software engineer for more than a decade now. I have worked as a\nsoftware engineer in 3 countries in the past 10 years. I am primarily a backend\nsoftware engineer who dabbles in the frontend side of things once in a while.</p>\n<p>I used to do public speaking even in 2010 but I restarted doing it in 2014 when\nI spoke at a meetup in Kathmandu, Nepal. Then I started sending out abstract to\nCFPs in 2015, and in 2016 I spoke at my first conference: Code Motion Dubai.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like meeting like-minded people with the profession in common. All of us are\nsolution providers at the end of the day at times with code and sometimes\nwithout code too. I like the positive energy conferences have and regardless of\nwhere you work or the number of years of experience one has all of the\nparticipants are there to learn and share the experience. I admire the time,\neffort and resources put in by speakers for their talk.</p>\n<p>Public speaking, to be honest, has benefited my career both directly and\nindirectly. It has surely given me recognition and many people have approached\nme after doing some public speaking for various reasons. To be honest, adding a\nsection in your CV where you have spoken in a couple of good conferences does\nadd more value.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>My first big conference talk was in August, 2016 in Amsterdam for Laracon EU.\nProbably that was the biggest audience I had spoken in front of and included all\nthe who’s who of that community. It was a talk on ChatOps and I think for that\ncommunity of people it was a relatively new thing then.</p>\n<p><span class=\"figcaption_hack\">Geshan’s first big conference talk at Laracon EU, 2016</span></p>\n<p>I think it went pretty well, I was shaky and nervous when I started of course\nand then after the first 10 minutes I think I was in the flow and telling most\nof the things I had to talk about.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, I have lost count on how many CFPs I have submitted my abstracts,\nfrom 2015 it surely should be in the 100s. I generally submit to conferences\nthat cover both travel and accommodations or at least travel. Like an e-commerce\nwebsite, I believe (at least for me) the conversion (success) rate is like 1% or\nless :). In total from 2016 to now I have spoken at 4 conferences in 4\ncontinents, not sure if it qualifies me to be called an international speaker\nfrom Nepal though :).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I narrate the talk to myself the night before. Then right before the talk, I\nmake sure I have things I need with me like water, screen connections, and that\nthe screen size is fine. After I get on stage, I focus on delivering the message\nwith the right impact.</p>\n<p>I try to keep preparation pretty simple: don’t over-prepare, keep things\nspontaneous, but have some direction and keep an eye on the time.</p>\n<p>I usually don’t have speaker notes so I look at the slides and then improvise on\nthem. That’s why even if I do the same talk a second time, the details I include\neach time will be different.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For new speakers, there are two main pieces of advice:</p>\n<p><strong>First, give your talk on local meetups.</strong> Local user group meetups are always\nlooking for speakers so if you approach them you will rarely hear a no you can’t\npresent. Depending on your city, the frequency of meetups in your area of tech\nmight be many, little, or none. When you practice your talk in a smaller group\nyou get feedback and also get over imposter syndrome.</p>\n<p>Speaking is not a thing for everyone, so try it in a smaller group. If you like\nit do it more, but bare in mind public speaking is a very important skill for\nyour career.</p>\n<p><strong>The second one is to work on your title and abstract.</strong> When conferences have\nCFPs the main thing in my opinion that stands out is your title and abstract.\nThe relevance of the talk in that conference is vital too, for instance, a Ruby\nconference will never accept a PHP 7 features talk. As some conferences have\nblind speaker selection, always work an extra bit on your title and abstracts.</p>\n<p>Then, it’s all about submitting your talk to all the CFPs you can find. The best\nway to find CFPs is <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">confs.tech</a>,\nlanyrd.com (it’s usually down though),\n<a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">callingallpapers.com</a>.

While writing talks are a huge time\ncommitment, there is nothing quite like explaining a concept to others to help\ncrystalize it in your mind.</p>\n<p>And, speaking is an incredible way to connect with other people outside of your\ntech silo and/or geographic area. It has also opened up additional career\nopportunities for me, and has resulted in growing in different directions as\nwell, like writing blog posts and answering interview questions!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do! It was a local first year conference. I think the talk was meant to be 20\nminutes or so and I was overly concerned about running short.</p>\n<p>It went pretty well, and people laughed at my jokes, but I was far more nervous\nthan I’d expected to be. If you want to judge for yourself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS8tO3Z6E7U&#x26;t=579s\">the video is\nonline</a>. I really should\nretool this talk and give it again.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//eS8tO3Z6E7U' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Laurie Barth’s first ever conference talk at DC Full Stack Web Summit, 2017</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I looked at my Trello board, and I’ve applied to around 35 conferences over the\ncourse of 3 years. I’ve been accepted at 12 and spoken at 9–10 of those.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I try to arrive in the room as early as I can after the previous speaker, and\nnormally I run the talk through without notes while getting ready that morning.\nAs long as I know I have the cues in my head I’m not worried about any further\nmemorization.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>My biggest piece of advice is about content.</p>\n<p>The talks that are most engaging to me include stories of failure, they talk\nabout learning something you don’t know and falling down along the way, or\nthey’re a new perspective from an outsider on a specific topic.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but I think it’s a great way to think about\npotential topics and to feel confident being honest with your audience. You’ll\nbe more memorable.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>So so many! I really couldn’t pick so I’ll try and talk about speakers with\ntotally different types of talks.</p>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nicholas Means</a> who takes you through\nincredibly real stories about disasters and almost disasters and what we can\nlearn from them.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//099cHWSbAL8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I love <a href=\"https://twitter.com/editingemily\">Emily Freeman</a> who talks about how the\nhuman reactions of all of us manifest themselves in our work and how that can\nhelp us be more cognizant of our actions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//dbKjzxd-f70' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>I’ve recently discovered some amazing speakers through youtube videos like\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/philip_roberts\">Philip Roberts</a> who did a great talk on the\njavascript event loop:</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//8aGhZQkoFbQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>Where can readers find out more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a website: <a href=\"http://laurieontech.com/\">laurieontech.com</a> (pardon the lack\nof responsive design, I just migrated to a new framework and it’s a work in\nprogress).

Like many software developers, <strong>I felt that I didn’t really\nhave that much to talk about, that my experience was not unique, and that\nsomeone in the audience would call me out for being a fraud.</strong></p>\n<h3>Overcoming the Fear</h3>\n<p>Grappling with the fear of inadequacy is a lifelong pursuit for many of us. I’m\nfortunate to not be crippled by it, but it still took me years to put myself out\nthere and give a technical talk.</p>\n<p>The way I overcame this fear was to <strong>start small</strong>. As I came up with talk\nideas I pitched them to local meetups and code bootcamps. After giving some of\nthese talks, I realized that the audience isn’t as scary as I thought. <em>These\nare just other developers who genuinely want to learn something, and I’m lucky\nenough to be helping them!</em></p>\n<h3>Setting the Goal</h3>\n<p>Four conferences was arbitrary. It felt like enough that I would be able to call\nmyself a “real” conference speaker, but not so many that I would have to travel\nall the time. I love traveling, but with a wife and puppy at home, I have\npractical limits.</p>\n<p>So, I settled on four, and started forming a plan for making it happen.</p>\n<h3>Making a Plan</h3>\n<p>When I create a personal goal, I don’t just write it down and check on it. The\nimportant part to goal-setting is making measurable milestones that you believe\nwill help you achieve that goal. In this case, I started by making a sub-goal:</p>\n<h4>Sub-Goal: Get Accepted to Speak at One Conference</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ Write 2 conference talk proposals</li>\n<li>✅ Create slides for the proposed talks</li>\n<li>✅ Find 40+ conference CFPs</li>\n<li>✅ Submit 2 proposals to 3+ conferences per week until I get accepted</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As I worked my way through the checklist (it probably took about 12 weeks in\nall), I learned a lot about how to write a good proposal and what conferences\nusually looked for. I was very careful to read the conference’s CFP page, but\nI’ll admit that I sometimes submitted proposals that weren’t an ideal fit\nanyway.</p>\n<p>Within a few weeks, <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/api-strat-2017-presentation\">I had gotten my first\nacceptance</a>! Now\nI knew what it would take to get a talk accepted, and I felt like I had some\nmomentum.</p>\n<h3>Oh Yeah, I Still Have to Prepare</h3>\n<p>With one conference booked, I started refining and practicing my proposed talk.\nThe very first time I went through the slides it took me 25 minutes…for a 45\nminute speaking slot…whoops!</p>\n<p>This is where the meetups came in. After I had practiced about 12 times on my\nown, I gave my talk to the local <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers-js-chicago\">Chicago Javascript\nmeetup</a>. I\npracticed solo several more times before giving it at the conference.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Va0ug0QDjguymVqLGXvU-g.png\" class=\"center\">\n<p>But while I was preparing, I was surprised to see acceptances continue rolling\nin. I ended up getting 7 accepts in the first few months of pitching my talk.</p>\n<h3>It Doesn’t Always Work Out</h3>\n<p>I was excited, but started to run into some tough decisions. One conference in\nRomania was the same weekend as a family obligation and two conferences were on\nthe exact same day, so I turned down the second one that accepted me. In another\nunexpected turn, one conference couldn’t get the attendance they needed, so it\nwas cancelled outright.</p>\n<p>That took my total for 2017/2018 down to four. A manageable number, and even\nbetter, I had hit my goal for the year! 🎉</p>\n<h3>The takeaway: CFPs seem hard, but they don’t have to be</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary\">I learned a lot in that first year\nspeaking</a>, and\nwhile I’ve dialed back the number of applications I submit, I’m still actively\nengaged in the speaking community, and submitting a few CFPs per month.</p>\n<p>The whole experience has showed me that speaking isn’t as scary as it seems, and\nsubmitting winning CFPs isn’t a black art. It inspired me to create something\nthat would help other speakers — new and experienced — improve their odds of\nsuccess and become better, more prolific speakers, and thus <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land was\nborn</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IANh995.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>CFP Land: Never Miss a Call for Proposals Again</h3>\n<p><strong>One of the most frustrating things for me was when I’d discover a great\nconference in a fantastic location just a few days or weeks too late.</strong> Once the\nCFP closes, you have to wait a whole year to get back in the mix, and keeping up\nwith dozens of conferences is a lot of work.</p>\n<p>Initially, I used <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr\">Airtable</a> to store\nall the conferences I could find. Each week, I’d manually check on them and\nupdate CFP dates and links as needed. It took valuable time away from the real\nwork of writing proposals and practicing my talk, so I thought this problem\nneeded a better solution.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, other conference aggregators and CFP websites already exist, but\nthe killer feature that they were missing was a single weekly reminder of all\nupcoming CFPs.</p>\n<p>This seems obvious, but I wouldn’t have thought of it if I hadn’t spent months\napplying for CFPs. <strong>As a speaker, I don’t want a huge list of conferences or a\nbunch of noise — I just want a focused, weekly reminder of all the CFPs that\nwould be right for me.</strong></p>\n<h3>The Present and the Future</h3>\n<p>In its current iteration, <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a> is an email\nnewsletter with all the upcoming CFPs listed in chronological order. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfp_land\">I also\nTweet each CFP</a> when it’s due in 30 days so\nfollowers have plenty of time to submit.</p>\n<p>As speakers have joined, I’ve gotten some great feedback, and am working on\nimprovements already. In the coming months, you’ll be able to filter CFPs by\nlocation, category, and whether or not travel/hotel costs are covered. I’m also\nworking to get more data from more sources so speakers are really sure to never\nmiss a CFP again.</p>\n<p>Of course, I can’t continue improving CFP Land without input from other\nspeakers!
