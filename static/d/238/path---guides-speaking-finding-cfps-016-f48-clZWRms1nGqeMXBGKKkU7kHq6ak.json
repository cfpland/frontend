The reality is that conferences get many more speakers interested in speaking than they have slots, so they almost always hold an open “Call for Proposals” or CFP.</p>\n<p><em>For more detail on how conferences select speakers, check out <a href=\"../how-conferences-choose/\">Section 3: How Conferences Choose Their Speakers</a></em></p>\n<p>Before you can submit any CFPs though, you’ll need to find them. In this section, we’ll look at various methods for finding conferences with open calls for proposals and selecting those that are worth your time.</p>\n<h2>Finding CFPs</h2>\n<p>There are several ways that you can find open CFPs.</p>\n<h3>1. Contact the Conference Directly</h3>\n<h3>2. Subscribe to the Conference’s Newsletter</h3>\n<h3>3. Use a CFP Aggregator</h3>\n<p>I’m biased towards this one - <a href=\"\">that’s why I started CFP Land</a> - but it’s also the most convenient method if you want to apply to speak at a lot of conferences. <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">Confs.tech</a>, and <a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">CallingAllPapers</a> are the most comprehensive CFP aggregators, and all three have access to similar datasets. At CFP Land, we add the perks that speakers can expect from the conference, but you could also look that information up yourself on each conference’s website.</p>\n<p>Any of these aggregators will have a list of open CFPs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>CFP Land and other tools</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Conference mailing list</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social media (esp Twitter)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Which CFPs to submit to?</h2>\n<h2>Questions to Ask</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What perks?
