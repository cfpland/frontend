I was really excited to hear from Bruce Lawson because HTML is such a core piece of technology for\nthe web, but so many of us take it for granted. As a member of the W3C‚Äôs HTML5.3 specification team and writer on the topic, I knew\nBruce would make for an interesting speaker to feature here.</p>\n<p>Read on to hear how Bruce got into tech from a background in music and acting, and some of his tips for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm an accessibility and web standards consultant (you can hire me!). Side projects are music: <a href=\"https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/category/my-music/\">writing and recording</a> and developing a new product called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swordcello\">SwordCello</a>, which isn‚Äôt released yet. I got into public speaking as a kid, when I was an actor.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>It used to be an integral part of my job in Developer Relations for Opera, now it‚Äôs for fun - it‚Äôs a good way of seeing old friends or visiting a new city. It‚Äôs definitely benefited my career, and hopefully helped my audience‚Äôs careers, too.</p>\n<h3>What makes HTML such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>HTML is the foundational language of the web: the greatest store of knowledge (and bullshit) ever. It‚Äôs forwards and backwards compatible. It‚Äôs developed to be accessible, work with any human language or script and to be secure. What‚Äôs not to love?</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6As5HEkG5E' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6As5HEkG5E\">Ensuring a High Performing Web for the Next Billion People</a>‚Äù by Bruce Lawson at Velocity Amsterdam</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It was a 15 minute talk about accessibility in the Netherlands. It went OK, as I remember. But it was very dry.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Ooh, about 150 I think. I probably only applied to about 10; the rest were invitations from the conference organiser.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Safety pee; check zip is up; make sure you have water (not sparkling, else you might burp down the mic). Go through your slides one last time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Even if you think your subject has been spoken about before, you‚Äôre bringing your own unique slant to it.</li>\n<li>Make sure you tell a story - you have a beginning, middle and end.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt spend ages introducing yourself.</li>\n<li>Never claim something is easy or obvious, just because it is to you.</li>\n<li>Put in a few jokes.</li>\n<li>Relax. If you dry up and can‚Äôt remember the next bit, take a sip of water so you don‚Äôt feel like a deer in the headlights.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt take questions; tell the audience that you‚Äôll be around the venue and they are more than welcome to approach you and ask you questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan\">Sara Soueidan</a> for her energy and passion; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mathias\">Mathias Bynens</a> for his geekery and humour; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaffathecake\">Jake Archibald</a> for his knowledge and wit; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> for her enthusiasm and knowledge.

After gathering feedback from hundreds of technology conference speakers, I realized that like me, many of them struggled to find and keep up with which CFPs were available and which ones they had applied to. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to make sure CFP Land was self-sustaining, so CFP Land Pro was born.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre considering a <a href=\"/members/\">Pro Membership</a>, read on to learn more about everything that‚Äôs included. Don‚Äôt hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:info@cfpland.com\">email me</a> if you have questions about how CFP Land can help you be a more successful speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2><span id=\"early-access\">1. Early Access to CFPs</span></h2>\n<p>The weekly CFP Land newsletter and <a href=\"/conferences/\">our free conference listings</a> show all CFPs that close in the next 21 days. Usually this is plenty of time to apply, but many conferences review applicants on a rolling basis. In those cases, <strong>applying as early as possible is advantageous</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular features among Pro Members is the early access to CFPs. If you‚Äôre not a Pro Member already, you won‚Äôt see any conferences tagged <code class=\"language-text\">‚¨ÜÔ∏è Pro</code> in your feed, but if you sign up for a Pro Membership, here‚Äôs what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png\" alt=\"Pro Members get access to CFPs 21 days before free members\"></a></p>\n<p>As a Pro Member, you can see all the CFPs in our database that are closing in the next <strong>42 days</strong>, meaning you‚Äôll be able to apply much earlier than free users.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"save-cfps\">2. Save CFPs</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/save-cfps-1.gif\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Save conferences to be reminded before they close\"></a></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs easy to lose track of which CFPs you want to submit when there are hundreds each month on CFP Land alone. <strong>Saving CFPs is a great way to keep up with the conferences that you care about most.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you save a CFP to your Pro account, you‚Äôll get email reminders 21, 7, and 3 days before it closes. This is great if you‚Äôre browsing CFPs on mobile, but you don‚Äôt want to forget to submit to them when you‚Äôre back at your computer.</p>\n<p>Another useful reason to save CFPs is to personalize your feed of upcoming Calls for Proposals. By default, there may be 50 to 100 open CFPs on the ‚ÄúAll‚Äù page, so saving CFPs will ensure you don‚Äôt have to wade through quite as many irrelevant conferences.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"export-cfps\">3. Export CFPs to Your Personal Calendar</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/export-cfps-2.gif\" alt=\"Using CFP Land Pro to export conferences to your calendar\"></a></p>\n<p>You don‚Äôt have to track your CFPs in CFP Land. Pro Members also get a calendar export tool that allows you to save CFPs to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook.</p>\n<p>This is helpful if you want to create custom reminders or use your own calendar notifications rather than the CFP Land emails.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"search-alerts\">4. Custom Search Alerts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-2.gif\" alt=\"Saving searches with your CFP Land Pro Membership\"></a></p>\n<p>All CFP Land users can use filters to search for conferences that match their preferences, but if you‚Äôre a free user, you will need to check the site periodically to make sure you don‚Äôt miss any new opportunities. In order to make your life a little easier, <strong>CFP Land Pro Members can save their searches to get an email alert when new CFPs are found that match their filters.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-3.png\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Email alert when results from a saved search are found\" /></a></p>\n<p>When a new conference CFP is found that matches one of your saved searches, you‚Äôll get an email about it, letting you know that you can either <a href=\"/blog/pro-saving-cfps/\">Save the CFP</a> or apply right away.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you‚Äôll never miss another great CFP once you set up your searches on <a href=\"/members/\">CFP Land Pro</a>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"abstracts\">5. Save Your Abstracts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/abstracts.png\" alt=\"Abstracts on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Most experienced speakers have a pool of abstracts that they could submit depending on the audience and conference focus. CFP Land Pro Members can save those Abstracts to their CFP Land account so that they can tie them to each CFP they submit.</p>\n<p>This is a great way to see which of your abstracts is the most successful and to remember which Abstract you submitted to which conference.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"track\">6. Track Your Submissions</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/track.gif\" alt=\"Track submissions on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Finally, if you submit dozens of Abstracts per year, it can be hard to keep up with all of them. In my first year of speaking, I used a giant spreadsheet to track over 50 submissions, and it got to be a huge mess.</p>\n<p>CFP Land Pro Members can track the conferences they‚Äôve applied to, been accepted at, and been rejected from in addition to attaching their Abstracts to each submission.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Much more will be coming soon, so if you‚Äôre interested, <a href=\"/members/\">your CFP Land Pro Membership is just a few clicks away</a>!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Pro Members Only: A Complete List of All the Features CFP Land Pro Members Get","path":"/blog/pro-features/","category":"Updates","tags":["Pro Features"],"date":"2020/02/07","image":"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Last year, I heard about a new conference called <a href=\"https://www.developer-first.com/conference\">Developer First</a> specifically for technology\nleaders. There are not a ton of conferences that focus on the people and leadership side of technology, so I was really excited to\napply, and even more honored to be selected for their first year. I also wanted to get to know the conference‚Äôs organizer a little better,\nso I reached out to Kate Wardin about doing an interview for CFP Land.</p>\n<p>Kate strikes me as one of those people who is a natural leader, but like many speakers, she started off terrified of getting up in front\nof an audience. Read on to hear her speaker‚Äôs story and her tips for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cuCV5BH66UNiamgKS4EyAPZgD8Vpiro-\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am currently a Senior Engineering Manager at Target Corp in Minneapolis, MN. I lead a team of amazing Engineers who build tools for our global supply chain users. Outside of my day job, I founded a company called Developer First to help organizations around the world build strong Engineering teams which I believe starts with developing confident, purposeful and inspiring leaders.</p>\n<p>I was absolutely terrified of public speaking throughout college and into the first couple years of my professional career. I avoided it at all costs and was a terrible speaker in front of an audience of any size. I eventually realized that I couldn‚Äôt continue avoiding public speaking and joined my organization‚Äôs Toastmaster‚Äôs club. I was thrilled to discover a safe and comfortable environment to practice my new skills and overcome my fears. I spent a couple years as a practicing member before being elected President of my local chapter.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is not a requirement of my role, but I enjoy the opportunity to connect with leaders outside of my organization and feel like I am inspiring and influencing others to reflect and potentially shift their mindsets on technical leadership.</p>\n<p><strong>My favorite experiences of speaking at conferences are the conversations I have with folks who approach me after my talk.</strong> It is very rewarding to hear how my ideas resonated with them and even more enjoyable when they share new ideas that I hadn‚Äôt thought of!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I speak about a variety of topics related to the unique challenges of being an engineering leader: people first leadership, time management, prioritization, effective communication, coaching developers, diversity &#x26; inclusion, effective on boarding programs, etc.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was part of an executive track at an engineering conference in NYC. I talked so fast that I finished my 45 minute talk in 20 minutes. I remember arriving to the speaker staging room 90 minutes early because I was so nervous that I would be late or not find the location. My confidence and skills were definitely lacking. However, I don‚Äôt regret any of it! I was passionate about the topic and strongly believe that you have to start somewhere. No video footage exists (thank goodness).</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied: hundreds</p>\n<p>Spoken at: ~25</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ut7jEkIf1ac' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7jEkIf1ac\">Developer First Leadership</a>‚Äù by Kate Wardin at React Boston</em></p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I usually run through the slides about an hour before my talk. <strong>The more familiar the ideas are, the more comfortable I am.</strong> After that, I try to relax and maybe go introduce myself to other attendees during the break before my talk.</p>\n<p>Another tip: make sure you check what type of projector or input is needed before you arrive to speak!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DON‚ÄôT WAIT. START WITH ANYTHING.</strong> Submit topics that you feel even somewhat confident to present on, and then invest the time to fully research, compile content, and practice(!!). It is amazing how your idea will flourish and grow the longer you have to reflect on the topic, gather feedback, and learn through other experiences. You just need to start with something - anything that you are passionate about. If you have an idea swirling in your head for longer than a couple weeks, take some time to start drafting an abstract and outline.</li>\n<li>Make sure you propose a topic that you are passionate about. There is nothing worse than a dull speaker who isn‚Äôt personally energized by the topic.</li>\n<li>READING THE ROOM: <strong>Nothing kills confidence faster than making eye contact with members of the audience who seem skeptical or not engaged.</strong> I like to find the person (or people) that actively shows feedback (nods, smiles) and focus my attention on them throughout my talk. As for those skeptics, I have found that it is dangerous to interpret the non-verbals of humans that you don‚Äôt personally know. In fact, on several occasions, some of those ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù (or so I thought) approached me after my talk and expressed gratitude and shared that they loved my topic.</li>\n<li>Join a frequent flyer/hotel chain rewards program. Admittedly, I also got into conference speaking because I wanted an excuse to travel more and rack up those airline/hotel points. Check and check.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.developer-first.com/\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-wardin/\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/developer_first\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upcoming talks: NoFluffJustStuff US tour, StretchCon Budapest, &#x26; Developer First Tech Leadership Conference</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.
