It took time, hard work, and lots of practice for Gant to get comfortable in front of a crowd, but fortunately he stuck with it. He’s now spoken at over 50 conferences, and made himself an integral part of the tech conference community. Keep reading to learn more about how Gant got started, what he recommends for new speakers, and some of the influencers that inspired him to continue his journey.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>When I was in college, I was paralyzed by the fear of public speaking. Just the thought of talking in front of a small class would cause cold-sweats. Fortunately, I was studying for a career in Comp Sci. which usually doesn’t require much public speaking.</p>\n<p>Once my career began, I was reaffirmed, no one wants to hear a developer speak. That was fine for a few years, and then new nagging energy began. People can’t listen if you don’t speak. Quietly interjecting important points without ever taking the lead of a conversation is less effective than not speaking at all. It was time to start breaking out of my shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Though I was uncomfortable, I started speaking up more and more.</strong> I attended conferences, and I marveled at speakers. I was amazed, but sure I would never be on the other side of the 4th wall.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can’t shut me up. It’s always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn’t comfortable, but it’s doable. Now <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">you can see I’ve been speaking actively for years</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m very fortunate that I work for the great people at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a> who have supported me from lightning talk to keynote speaker.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>The best thing about speaking at conferences is the networking and connection. I’ve made friends around the world.</strong> This has, directly AND indirectly, benefited my career and employer. It’s not required in my job description, but it’s valuable to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>There’s something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts. I’m still an introvert, but it doesn’t matter who you are, something like that feels great. The community and positivity of it all is superb!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>After a lot of Toastmasters, and speaking at a local meetup, my first “conference” talk was a lightning slot at RubyConf 2013.</p>\n<p>How’d it go? Well, my heart was beating through my chest. But I gave a 30-minute presentation in 5 minutes after getting over my fear of public speaking, so there was no way to fail :)</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJOkpP__dY4?start=4829' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Gant Laborde at RubyConf, 2013</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>50+ and no stopping in sight!</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XfgC3IW.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde/status/1107007420763639808\">general rules for sure</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No dairy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\">Power Pose</a></li>\n<li>Think more about your audience than yourself</li>\n<li>Realize the audience wants you to succeed, and they can’t see that you’re nervous unless you tell them.</li>\n<li>They will feel what you feel. So 😃 (smile)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You’re not done and you’re not stuck. <strong>For a lot of people, level 1 was just speaking. Then it’s to speak well. Then it’s to fill a room, then get invited to speak, then keynote.</strong> The best speakers are people who have been leveling up for 20+ years, and they support and promote speakers who are just getting started. It’s not a zero-sum game, ask for help, get feedback, and improve. Then repeat. The best speakers aren’t born speakers.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I LOVE TED TALKS! <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gantlaborde/5-ted-talks-that-changed-me-4aa0cec43d79\">Here’s 5 that have made me recontextualize life</a>.</p>\n<p>As for Tech, I’d say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jevakallio\">Jani Evakallio</a> has been amazing every talk I see. His experience (not talk, but experience) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVcMAtaAwsA\">at RNEU was terrific for everyone in the audience</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, if you haven’t seen Charlie Chaplin’s speech in <em>The Great Dictator</em>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8HdOHrc3OQ\">prepare to have your mind blown</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>All my upcoming talks are available <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">on my site</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Follow me on Twitter</a> where semi-smart memes happen.</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gantlaborde\">here’s my Medium</a>, where I can’t seem to shut up.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, say “hi” if I’m ever at a conference and you’re there.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Gant Laborde, Technology Team Leader, Speaker and Author","path":"/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/06","image":"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests. At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Tejas Kumar has dealt with haemophilia his whole life, but despite his disease preventing him from completing a traditional computer science education, he’s used his self-taught knowledge and communication skills to achieve success as a developer. Now, as a tech conference speaker, he’s giving back to other developers by passing on what he knows. Looking through Tejas’ social profiles, you’ll see that he doesn’t take himself too seriously, but his informal, casual tone is part of what makes him a unique and interesting speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m Tejas. I love people and code and the conversations we have together. I’ve been a public speaker since a young age. I grew up with a fatal sickness (that I still have) where I couldn’t do much and I often felt like I’d never amount to much, so in some ways, I guess I’ve been drawn to public speaking to overcompensate. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MdV43uT.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like encouraging the community. I often learn things and I enjoy disseminating the information from stages and then having conversations about it later. <strong>Truth be told, I enjoy the private conversations that happen after a good talk <em>a lot</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>While it has directly benefited my career with a number of job offers, visibility, Twitter followers, all kinds of glitz and glam, the real value I see from this type of engagement is the love. I get to share hope with people, combat impostor syndrome, and see careers flourish; life change from a stage. It’s all very encouraging.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember doing a TEDx talk like 7 years ago. It was really well received. I think there was even a standing ovation. It was fun. 🙂</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUIcTl9Hto4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tejas presenting “Papercuts Can Kill” at TEDx</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I’ve applied to like 20 and spoken at like 9? It’s a gut feeling though. I have no real idea.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I often put myself into the mindset of “I’ve won” already before I even play.</strong> This gives me hope and like prepares me to do an amazing job. Eventually, it somehow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Odd, maybe, but it works for me every time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You’d be surprised by how much value you can add with a talk. Our tech industry today is so full of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1126096390281732097\">faux confidence and pretend knowledge</a> that one would often feel like they don’t know enough – I know I feel this way most of the time. The truth is, I actually know quite a bit <em>in my own, very specific area</em> that I can use to educate and help others who aren’t as familiar with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m often insecure about kubernetes, data structures and algorithms, and CS fundamentals because I personally was always too sick to get a Computer Science degree. I don’t have one. I am a prime example of impostor syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, I feel there are just as many people insecure about React, TypeScript, CSS and other areas. I rejoice at the idea of combating their impostor syndrome with my experience in these subjects. For me, this is part of the joy of public speaking along these themes.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been extremely uncomfortable with my <em>content</em> not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I’ve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to better my technical abilities to “close the loop”.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’ve been inspired by a lot of speakers, inside and outside of tech circles. I especially appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweststrate\">Michel Weststrate</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a>’s speaking styles as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darcar31\">Daria Caraway</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I’m most active on twitter under <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tejaskumar_\">@tejaskumar_</a>. I also have a website where people can learn to code and/or troll me depending on their mood at <a href=\"https://tejaskumar.com/\">tejaskumar.com</a>.</p>\n<p>My next talk is not yet announced, but one talk coming up is at JSConf Budapest about the performance of various UI frameworks in serverless architectures.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Tejas Kumar, Lifelong Speaker and Frontend Development Lead","path":"/blog/speakers-story-tejas-kumar/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/06/29","image":"https://i.imgur.com/MdV43uT.png"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests. At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to meet Matt in real life at Midwest PHP, 2019 as he was giving one of the keynotes there. I think our first conversation was awkward nods in the hotel gym way too early before the conference, but once that was over, we got to talk throughout the conference.</p>\n<p>In addition to speaking, Matt is an active open source maintainer, and has been giving back to the PHP community in various ways for the past several years. He also speaks on behalf of <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">OSMI</a> - a great organization that helps raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech community - so I’m excited to present his journey into speaking and tips for those who are new to it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>During the day I’m a senior software engineer at a company called MoreCommerce where we do small and medium-sized business e-commerce and market place offerings. Outside of that, I help maintain various API related OSS projects like Fractal, openapi.tools, standards.rest and a few others. I spend most of my free time doing photography or cycling.</p>\n<p>As for speaking, I got my start at my old PHP user group in Atlanta. I started with a lightning talk and moved up to a full-length talk before breaking into a conference. Im usually pretty shy and quiet, so it was weird at first but it been a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about speaking is <strong>it’s an excuse to learn and play with new technology</strong>. I wouldn’t have become passionate about the OpenAPI spec if a conference hadn’t given me a chance to speak on it for example. And because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, <strong>giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn’t touch at work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It feels so long ago, but my first talk was at a now-defunct conference called “Great Wide Open”. I submitted a talk essentially about why community is awesome and how it can help someone learn. Since it was my first talk I was incredibly nervous but somehow I pulled it off. I got good feedback for it, and felt like I could have massaged it a bit into a more full talk.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>This year I will have spoken at 5, including 2 (maybe 3) keynotes. That’s the most I’ve ever done. Last year I spoke at one conference.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I usually put on some music, like Run The Jewels and just zone out.</strong> I tend not to sit in a talk before my slot so I can keep my thoughts going. Everyone is different, what works for me doesn’t mean it’ll work for someone else. I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing. I’m also bad in that I will still be doing slides up until my talk. I should fix that.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For your first talk, <strong>pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgable about.</strong> Don’t experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.</p>\n<p>When you submit your CFP, check your spelling and grammar. It’s amazing how many people overlook it.</p>\n<p>Another thing is <strong>don’t immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, submit multiple submissions, it gives you better odds. When we organized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/southeastphp\">Southeast PHP</a>, people with multiple submissions had a better shot getting into our post-apocalyptic Thunderdome over someone who only gave us one thing to choose.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty short so I look up to pretty much everyone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jenna Quindica</li>\n<li>Josh Holmes</li>\n<li>Kat Zień</li>\n<li>Phil Sturgeon</li>\n<li>Ben
