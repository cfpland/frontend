The community has been amazingly welcoming and helpful, so this month, I wanted to give something back to the community by releasing a comprehensive guide I’ve been compiling for current and aspiring technology conference speakers.</p>\n<p>Because everyone reading this will start at a different level of experience speaking, I wanted to break the advice down into manageable chunks. These “chapters” can be read independently, or straight through as you see fit.</p>\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/introduction\">An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a></li>\n<li>Why Speak? The Reason Sane People Get on Stage</li>\n<li>How Conferences Choose Speakers</li>\n<li>Finding CFPs (“Calls for Proposals”)</li>\n<li>Submitting Abstracts</li>\n<li>What Comes Next? Dealing with Success or Rejection</li>\n<li>Preparing a Presentation</li>\n<li>Pre-Conference Preparations</li>\n<li>101 Opinionated Tips for Speakers of All Levels</li>\n<li>Joining the Speaker Community</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you read through these chapters, you may have your own ideas or resources to suggest. That’s great! I’d love to continue refining and building this guide with help from the community. Just <a href=\"mailto:info@cfpland.com\">shoot me an email</a> with the tips you’d like to add, and I’ll keep updating this resource.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/#\">Get Started: An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"The Comprehensive Guide to Speaking at Technology Conferences in 2020","path":"/guides/speaking/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
