They stick out like a sore thumb in otherwise potentially well written submissions.

Given a topic like “security” or “performance” I write down as many other words come to mind. I then stack rank them based on which are the most interesting. I write about 10-20 different intro sentences. About 3-4 different copies of the “takeaway” sentences, and about 5-10 outro sentences.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve done it too, which now makes me able to see why we can do better. Trust me, we’ve all seen the Angular 2 talks already. Don’t copy your predecessors.

Especially early on, I always had a feeling of “everyone in the audience will already know what I’m talking about.” That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/\">John Riviello</a></li>\n<li>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you’ve got friends in the audience — some you may know, and some you may not know…yet. - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/</a></li>\n<li>“I’ve always been extremely uncomfortable with my content not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I’ve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-tejas-kumar/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-tejas-kumar/</a></li>\n<li>“Feeling the pre-conference jitters is totally normal. I tell people all the time that if you don’t feel nervous before your talk, including the day of, you might want to go to the doctor. Indeed there is something wrong with your nervous system.” - <a href=\"https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d\">https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"What Comes Next?
