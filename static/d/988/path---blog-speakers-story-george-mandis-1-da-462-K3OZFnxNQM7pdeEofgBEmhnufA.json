How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">George Mandis</a>. I‚Äôm currently a full stack, independent web developer at <a href=\"https://snaptortoise.com/\">SnapTortoise</a> based out of Portland, Oregon, though I wear quite a few other hats. I‚Äôve been freelancing for 13 years, but over the past 4 or 5 years I‚Äôve gravitated towards mentorship roles. Teaching classes, workshops, leading bootcamps and working with junior developers one-on-one has been a rewarding experience and speaking feels like a natural extension to this.</p>\n<p>My first foray into speaking was actually at an Ignite event in Portland where I summarized, in 5 minutes, my experience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2QC43jwPyM\">living as a digital nomad</a> for a year. I was terrified to speak in front of so many people, but it went well! After that I though I should look into conference speaking as a way to advance myself professionally, extend the aforementioned mentoring activities I mentioned and continue to travel and see the world, which is one my biggest passions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2QC43jwPyM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things ‚Äî not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!</strong> It‚Äôs always interesting to me to see one type of work or technology in-demand in one place and find it barely mentioned at all in another. It‚Äôs also nice to humanize other developers and put a face and a personality to a name. These conferences also have a tendency to be expensive and difficult to otherwise attend, as an independent developer. Being able to attend these conferences and pick the brain of people who work at some very large, influential tech companies is a wonderful opportunity.</p>\n<p>I think the process of preparing a talk and speaking in front of a large group people could benefit anyone‚Äôs career, but for mine it‚Äôs certainly opened some doors. <strong>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.</strong> The other benefit of speaking is I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a great opportunity to talk about the things you want to be doing, even if it‚Äôs not the thing you‚Äôre necessarily doing in your day-to-day. My talks tend to focus on creativity, art, hardware-dabbling and making interesting, outside-the-box projects through JavaScript. Speaking on these topics has allowed me to spend more time immersed in that world and meet other like-minded and very talented people with similar interests.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My very first ‚Äútalk‚Äù was the 5-minute Ignite talk I mentioned earlier, but my first <em>technical</em> talk was at HolyJS in Russia. I remember applying to a number of conferences by that point in the year. Some had accepted me but had no budget for travel, but HolyJS was the first one where everything lined up.</p>\n<p>The idea of talking for a full hour was incredibly daunting ‚Äî I‚Äôd never done that before! When I pulled up the conference website I became even more nervous ‚Äî David Crockford and Lea Verou were two developers I‚Äôd read and followed for most of my career, and they were head-lining the conference! My attitude going in was, <strong>if this goes terribly, at least I‚Äôm 2000 miles from home and probably won‚Äôt ever run into any of these people again.</strong> It sounds funny, but it really took the pressure off! Fortunately it went well, and I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôve seen several familiar faces from that conference at other conferences since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>At the time of this response, I have applied to 28 conferences. Thus far, I have been accepted to speak at 6 of the 16 conferences that have announced their speakers (1 of which I‚Äôve already done).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine consists of taking one last look at my slides, a few deep breaths, and listening to whatever song that currently has my ears hostage (typically something upbeat and relatively positive with great musicality).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I would pass on some of the best advice I‚Äôve received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a topic that you wouldn‚Äôt mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.</li>\n<li>Write your abstract in such a way that the reader gets a pretty good understanding of why they should be at your talk and what they will get from attending.</li>\n<li>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you‚Äôve got friends in the audience ‚Äî some you may know, and some you may not know‚Ä¶yet.</li>\n<li>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts ‚Äî <strong>I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.</strong> I‚Äôve found this particularly helpful for tweaking my abstracts and tailoring my talks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Oh, I have plenty! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a> is one of my favorites ‚Äî I know her, she‚Äôs relatable, she doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously, and she has a ball on stage sharing what she knows. I‚Äôm also inspired by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techgirl1908\">Angie Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrShirleyDavis\">Dr. Shirley Davis</a>. I aspire to these levels of awesomeness and badassery.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?
