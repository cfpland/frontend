Over the past several years, I would speak here and there, generally after\nbeing invited by someone involved with the event. But last year I was looking\ninto conferences I might want to attend for women in tech, and I saw a CFP on\nthe website for one of them. I thought, “Oh, maybe instead of just attending\nthese conferences, I could speak at them,” and I was right!</p>\n<p>I wish I had realized sooner that <strong>you don’t always have to be personally\ninvited to speak at events.</strong> Now that I’m aware of the CFP process, I’m\nspeaking regularly at conferences across the country.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences? Has it benefited your career?</h3>\n<p>I think conferences can be such a fun way to meet people, whether you’re\nspeaking or not. But I have to admit, being a speaker has its perks. There are\ndinners, networking events, sometimes lounges specifically for the speakers,\nwhich build an immediate sense of community. I’ve been blown away by some of the\nother speakers I’ve met in these settings.</p>\n<p>Speaking also establishes your authority in your subject area, and it gives you\nthe chance to genuinely help people learn something new. This teaching aspect is\nespecially important to me, given my background in the education space.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Being in EdTech, I’ve always spoken at events for teachers, which was a natural\nprogression from being in the classroom and participating in or leading\nprofessional development sessions. But my first speaking engagement that was for\nmore of a technical and business-oriented audience was on a panel of EdTech\nentrepreneurs at <a href=\"https://1871.com/\">Chicago’s tech incubator and hub, 1871</a>.\nOne of the organizers had seen me giving a product demo and asked for me to join\nthe event, perhaps to help them avoid the dreaded all-male panel (or “manel”).</p>\n<p>And again, this experience corrected some misconceptions I had about public\nspeaking. I used to think all panelists must be exceptional at coming up with\noff-the-cuff responses to tricky questions on the spot, and maybe some of them\nare, but that’s definitely not the norm.</p>\n<p>In my experience at the 1871’s event, the panelists were all given the questions\nahead of time so we could prepare, and I was asked if I’d be comfortable kicking\nthe panel off by responding to the first question. I didn’t need to worry about\ncoming up with responses in the moment, because I was prepped ahead of time,\nwhich made the experience a lot less intimidating. And the format of a panel —\nbeing seated, one in a row of several speakers — creates a more casual vibe as\nwell. <strong>I’d definitely recommend panels as a gateway experience for anyone who\nis considering branching out into public speaking.</strong></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve spoken at about 10 conferences to date, and I currently have 4 more\nscheduled in the coming months. I don’t keep count on how many I’ve applied to,\nbut it’s been a lot! <strong>I definitely don’t get accepted to every event — I don’t\nthink anyone does.</strong> But I’ve very much enjoyed the conferences I’ve been a part\nof, and I’m looking forward to the ones ahead.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I try to access the room some time before my session to make sure the AV setup\nis good to go, but apart from that, I’m usually attending someone else’s session\nright up until it’s time for mine to start!</p>\n<p>I know not everyone’s schedules allow them to spend the full day at the event,\nbut <strong>I think it’s a shame when speakers come in just for their session and then\nleave.</strong> I make it a point to support and learn from the other speakers when I’m\nat a conference, so my session is usually one of many that I participate in\nthroughout the day.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>My biggest piece of advice is to just go for it!</p>\n<p>I’m involved in a lot of online communities, and I’ll see people posting in\nSlack, asking if they should respond to a CFP they’re interested in. My response\nis always yes. Why not? <strong>It doesn’t take much to respond to a CFP. You don’t\nhave to have a whole session ready to go. You just need an idea and an\nabstract.</strong></p>\n<p>Think of something you’ve been successful at professionally, and then think of\nwhat advice you’d give to others on that topic. Can you come up with 5–10 tips\nto make your audience better at X? A coding language, a new tool, even a soft\nskill? Then you’ve got enough to respond to a CFP.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of resources on writing strong CFP submissions, so I’d recommend\ndoing a little research in that area, but <strong>don’t be intimidated, especially if\nyou’re a member of an underrepresented group. Conferences need more\nrepresentation of diversity and inclusion.</strong> Go for it!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers who have inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One that comes to mind is Jennifer Wesley at Google, who gave the opening\nremarks at the Women Techmakers Summit in Chicago for International Women’s Day\nrecently. She stands out to me because she was able to get personal on stage,\nand in doing so, she established that the summit was a safe space for women.\n<strong>By being willing to be a little vulnerable with her personal story, she set\nthe tone for the whole day.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/95g2cd8pwe8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Jennifer Wesley at TEDxParker speaking about women in STEM</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I always post about my upcoming sessions on\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/LBJanusek\">Twitter</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbjanusek/\">LinkedIn</a>, and I share speaker\ndiscounts there when I can, so follow or connect with me if you’re interested.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you’re a tech conference speaker, email karl@cfpland.com to tell your story. 💌</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker’s Story: Laura Janusek, Chief Product Officer in Educational Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/03/31","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0KSCAln6MEJrW0a3URY6ow.jpeg"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
