Today, I‚Äôm happy to bring you Avdi Grimm,\na Ruby developer and professional paired programmer who will be giving a talk on programming and philosophy (I love these kind\nof talks).</p>\n<p>In this interview, Avdi shares some of his thoughts on how code is used as a model for life and the benefits he‚Äôs seen\nfrom 10 years of public speaking.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Yke3jpFDhT96A8qM5vGn1zAHS2bUBDSW\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a developer who spends most of his time coaching and educating other developers these days. My primary source of income is <a href=\"https://www.rubytapas.com/\">RubyTapas.com</a>, a subscription screencast site I created for developers nine years ago. I specialize in making frequent, short, tightly-edited videos that introduce developers to one new and useful idea at a time.</p>\n<p>I got started speaking around 2010. <strong>I think my biggest reason was that back then I was under the misapprehension that I was an introvert, and speaking seemed like a handy socialization hack.</strong> The idea was, if I give a talk, people will introduce themselves to me!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love public speaking for its own sake, and I also very much enjoy traveling and meeting people. Speaking is interesting because on the one hand, it has been instrumental to my career. But on the other hand, it‚Äôs hard to trace the individual strands of causality. <strong>Many of my most delightful opportunities have stemmed from friends I made at a conference years earlier.</strong></p>\n<h3>What makes the intersection of philosophy and software such an interesting topic to you?</h3>\n<p>I honestly believe that <strong>programming is fundamentally the practice applied philosophy.</strong> We use code to model ways of thinking about the world we live in. And when our code is used by large numbers of people, it impacts how they see the world.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs a lot of power, and a lot of responsibility. It‚Äôs also an opportunity: learning to think critically and intentionally about the philosophical nature of our work can reveal new ways to bring our values and our work into alignment.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I think my first-ever talk was at an open-source conference in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was about tools for remote work, and it was not well-attended üòÖ</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I used to meditate a bit to calm myself down, with limited success. These days my favorite way to get ready is to be distracted by a conversation with an attendee until the moment comes to go on stage.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit early, submit often.</li>\n<li>It‚Äôs OK to submit an abstract on a topic you want to understand better: getting accepted will give you a great excuse to learn about it!</li>\n<li>In both proposals and the talks themselves, lead with a problem, not with information. What is your ideal audience-member worried about or frustrated with?</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt agonize over long articles about all the things you need to remember in order to give a good talk. Give yourself permission to suck at every aspect of doing your talk except one. E.g. maybe you‚Äôll suck at slides, pacing, narrative arc, delivery‚Ä¶ BUT you‚Äôll have some really funny stories! Then, in later talks, pick ONE new aspect to do be better at each time.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-Q_dXVQM1c' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù[No Return: Moving beyond transactions in software and in life](<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Q</a></em>dXVQM1c)‚Äù by Avdi Grimm_</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

This week, I‚Äôm featuring my interview with Denise Yu, a\nSenior Software Engineer at GitHub who has found speaking to be a great springboard for her career in tech.</p>\n<p>Like many speakers I‚Äôve talked to over the past year, Denise comes from a nontraditional background, and is deeply passionate about helping\nother speakers get their starts. She also included some great recommendations for other speakers to watch, so be sure\nto look for that section towards the end.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm about to start a job as a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub, working on the Community &#x26; Safety team. I previously worked at Pivotal in their Cloud R&#x26;D business, where I wrote lots of YAML and pair-programmed everyday.</p>\n<p>I make tech art ‚Äî mostly, doodling things quickly when I‚Äôm watching people speak at conferences, but also cat-related doodles of technical concepts, at <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/art/\">deniseyu.io/art</a>. I started public speaking when I was about 12 years old, because at that time I thought I wanted to grow up and become a lawyer. I joined my school‚Äôs debate club, and spent about the next 12 years participating, judging, teaching, and facilitating competitive debate, Model UN, Mock Trial, and lots of other speaking-related extracurricular activities.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>For me, technical speaking has been a pretty significant career accelerator. I‚Äôve met gracious and talented engineers who I consider to be mentors and sponsors, and <strong>I‚Äôve been able to network my way into every single job I‚Äôve taken, after my first job in tech, either as a direct or indirect result of my participation in public speaking at meetups and conferences. There‚Äôs no such thing as being too junior when you‚Äôre brave enough to get up in front of an audience and share what you know.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking has never officially been part of my job, but I‚Äôve been lucky to have had employers who supported my speaking endeavors by granting me paid time off to travel to conferences.</p>\n<h3>What makes distributed systems such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>I career-switched and didn‚Äôt study computer science in undergrad, so I have a persistent sense of imposter syndrome around missing out on foundational knowledge.</p>\n<p>I started becoming interested in the mechanics of distributed computing while debugging RabbitMQ issues in production a few years ago. I can‚Äôt remember the specifics now, but a customer experienced a network partition, and the RabbitMQ cluster nodes came back to life in an unexpected order, which caused a host of unexpected side effects.</p>\n<p>I had such poor understanding of the design decisions for partition recovery strategies, that I decided to start doing my own research, and uncovered a world of deep, deep academic research into resilience engineering for distributed systems. For someone with no computer science background, I found the reading material out there to be targeted at advanced practitioners, and it was so difficult to me to get started on learning about distsys, so I did the reasonable thing, which was to submit a talk proposal to DevOpsDays London promising to compare partition recovery strategies between a few popular open-source databases. (Side note: This was not a reasonable thing to do.)</p>\n<p>While I was writing this talk, I was also reading Martin Kleppmann‚Äôs book ‚ÄúDesigning Data-Intensive Applications‚Äù, and I realized that before I could even talk about network partition recovery strategies, I had to spend a significant amount of time laying groundwork around why these strategies even needed to exist in the first place. The talk evolved from ‚ÄúRabbitMQ vs. Kafka vs. Cassandra‚Äù into a more general discussion of why distributed systems are so hard to understand, operate, and maintain. I think that as this talk has further iterated and evolved, the constant thread has been that distributed systems are difficult to learn about, and there is always space to revisit the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I spoke at was SwanseaCon in 2017. I delivered a talk titled ‚ÄúBuilding Empowered Teams at Scale‚Äù. I am not sure if it was recorded, but <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/talks\">the slides are available on my website</a>.</p>\n<p>I pitched the talk because in my first few months at Pivotal, I saw that the product teams were so much more empowered to make their own decisions, than previous teams I‚Äôd worked on, and I thought that some pieces of our philosophy around building and managing teams would be interesting to share with the world.</p>\n<p><strong>I was terrified - not about presenting in public, but specifically about speaking to a room full of engineers who knew a lot more about software and organizations than I did.</strong> I remember being so nervous about the talk that I started writing it seven months in advance. My manager helped me connect with people in leadership within the org to interview about their perspectives ‚Äî which actually ended up being a really cool way to build rapport with very senior-level folks that I didn‚Äôt have day-to-day contact with.</p>\n<p>I think the talk went well - to be honest, my brain completely blurs out the exact memories of being on stage usually - but I was proud that I had pushed myself to pitch, create, and deliver a full-length conference talk, about 2.5 years into my career in tech so far.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I‚Äôve spoken at upwards of 20 conferences. I‚Äôve applied to more - I think I applied to 10 conferences last year and got accepted to 7. This year I‚Äôve been recycling talks and being less ambitious about submitting, because I‚Äôm switching jobs and want to invest my energy in getting ramped up.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>When I develop a new talk, I spend a lot of time doing research. I actually <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/2018/09/24/writing-tech-talks.html\">blogged about my process here</a>!</p>\n<p>As a former debate kid, <strong>the key thing that‚Äôs always worked for me is practicing in front of diverse test audiences before the big day.</strong> When I lived in London and was developing new talks regularly, I had a crew of tech friends who didn‚Äôt work with me at Pivotal, and I‚Äôd invite them over, cook them dinner, feed them wine and beer, and run my talk for them and ask for feedback. This always caught ‚ÄúPivotal-isms‚Äù that I subconsciously put in, and it‚Äôd be a good way to level-set about whether my talk made sense to people who didn‚Äôt work on the same types of software that I did.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I also have decks on this! I sometimes help local meetups with training new speaker and drumming up talk submissions for CFPs. <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/techtalks\">Here‚Äôs the 15-minute deck that I usually run</a>.</p>\n<p>For new speakers, particularly folks with non-linear trajectories into the tech industry like myself, I always tell them this: <strong>Your story is interesting. You have a unique voice and set of experiences, and someone out there wants to hear your story.</strong></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs great to get started with smaller and lower-pressure speaking environments like meetups and possibly even presenting to bootcamp students or university student groups.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQrNOMO7UDk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚Äù<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQrNOMO7UDk\">How to Tech Talk</a>‚Äù by Denise Yu</em></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?
