How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GLa6cwP.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a software engineer from Kansas City, Missouri. I love to tech, and I love to share the cool things I‚Äôve learned with other people.</p>\n<p>I have always enjoyed going to schools to speak to students, but I was intrigued by conference speaking. One fateful evening I told <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a>, founder of Kansas City Women in Technology, that I was interested in speaking at tech conferences. She volunteered to be my mentor, set me up with resources for writing abstracts, and she sent me links to open CFPs for various conferences for me to begin submitting those abstracts. It felt like a whirlwind of events‚Ä¶I was writing abstracts the first week of December 2018, submitting those to conferences within the next week, and I got my first acceptance in January!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I‚Äôm providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.</p>\n<p>I do believe it has benefited my career, and it has helped me to shine a light on the things I believe are great.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference was DevFest KC this past February in Kansas City. <strong>I was super nervous, and I told the audience this was my first time speaking at a conference. I‚Äôm used to trying to engage small groups of teenagers, not 20-40 adults.</strong> However, I needn‚Äôt have worried so much. My audience was engaged, they asked questions, and they were eager to participate. By the end of the talk, they didn‚Äôt believe that was my first time.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312227563\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          \n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/312227563\">Rhia Dixon at the KC Women in Technology 2019 Kickoff</a></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>At the time of this response, I have applied to 28 conferences. Thus far, I have been accepted to speak at 6 of the 16 conferences that have announced their speakers (1 of which I‚Äôve already done).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine consists of taking one last look at my slides, a few deep breaths, and listening to whatever song that currently has my ears hostage (typically something upbeat and relatively positive with great musicality).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I would pass on some of the best advice I‚Äôve received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a topic that you wouldn‚Äôt mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.</li>\n<li>Write your abstract in such a way that the reader gets a pretty good understanding of why they should be at your talk and what they will get from attending.</li>\n<li>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you‚Äôve got friends in the audience ‚Äî some you may know, and some you may not know‚Ä¶yet.</li>\n<li>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts ‚Äî <strong>I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.</strong> I‚Äôve found this particularly helpful for tweaking my abstracts and tailoring my talks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Oh, I have plenty! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a> is one of my favorites ‚Äî I know her, she‚Äôs relatable, she doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously, and she has a ball on stage sharing what she knows. I‚Äôm also inspired by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techgirl1908\">Angie Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrShirleyDavis\">Dr. Shirley Davis</a>.

I currently work at Comcast where I am the lead web developer for xFi. My first public presentation was at a Sass meetup in Philadelphia in 2012 where I volunteered to talk about a new open source project I was working on. From there I spoke at a few ‚Äúunconferences‚Äù &#x26; ‚Äúunconference tracks‚Äù at other conferences (where basically as long as you show up and there‚Äôs an open speaking slot, it‚Äôs yours) before I was first accepted to speak at a conference.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxfoundation/44425350705/in/faves-17844497@N00/\">The Linux Foundation, some rights reserved</a></em></p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The thing I enjoy the most is sharing my experiences, both on stage and in the conversations with attendees afterwards. It has also allowed me to travel to some fun and interesting places.</p>\n<p>There are a couple areas where it has directly benefited my career. <strong>I was given the opportunity to <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Sass-Converting-Existing-Site/434463-2.html\">create a course for Lynda.com</a> because I met Lynda.com staff author <a href=\"http://www.raybo.org/\">Ray Villalobos</a> after we both spoke at a conference.</strong> It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray. In addition, at my current role at Comcast I am expected to be having an impact outside of the company, and public speaking is the path I‚Äôve been leaning on to accomplish that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I was accepted to speak at via a CFP was the University of Illinois Web Conference in 2015. When I talked to folks that attended afterwards, everyone had good things to say, but given it was my first talk I essentially took that as I did not too anything terribly wrong, which was a great first step.</p>\n<p>My favorite talk I‚Äôve given so far is ‚ÄúThe Critical Career Path Conversation‚Äù which I premiered at The Lead Developer NYC in 2018. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLBzScQzZ83I8H8_0Qete6Bs5EcW3p0kZF&#x26;v=hMz6QDURQOM\">view it on YouTube</a>, including a fun glitch about one-third of the way through for you all to enjoy watching me struggle &#x26; recover from.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMz6QDURQOM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to about 70 so far and spoken at 20.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it üòú.</p>\n<p>I usually spend the hour before looking and my slide notes one last time and inevitably tweak a few things here or there. My system is to write out what I‚Äôm planning to say for each slide in the slide notes but then I rarely ever follow it directly once I start talking. It‚Äôs just a comfort feeling knowing that if I totally forget what I was going to say, the script is there.</p>\n<p>The last thing I do, which I do recommend, is to <strong>make sure you start off smiling</strong> üòÉ.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is so much I could say here but I‚Äôll limit it to a few quick hits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Imposter syndrome is real and a totally normal feeling</strong>, so do not let that hold you back. Especially early on, I always had a feeling of ‚Äúeveryone in the audience will already know what I‚Äôm talking about.‚Äù That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During the intro of your talk, let the audience know how you intend to take questions (raise your hand during the talk, hold them until the end, chat in the hallway later, email, etc.). If someone asks a question that you don‚Äôt know the answer to, it is much better to say ‚ÄúThat is a great question. I don‚Äôt know what the answer is so let me get back to you,‚Äù than to try to make up an answer on the spot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My CFP acceptance rate went up when I internalized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344\">this piece of advice from Fluent organizer Kyle Simpson</a>:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/advice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#advice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/designingATalk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#designingATalk</a><br><br>OK talks are about the topic.<br><br>Good talks are about the speaker/presentation.<br><br>Great talks are about the audience.</p>&mdash; getify (@getify) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are 2 in particular that I look up to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://meowni.ca/\">Monica Dinculescu</a> because when it comes to technical knowledge, she does an excellent job of taking a topic and distilling it down so that the audience can understand it and apply it immediately. She is able to do it while keeping her talk entertaining with healthy doses of humor and emojis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agiledeveloper.com/\">Venkat Subramaniam</a> is a marathon speaker that I am amazed by. He is a superhuman when it comes to learning new content and teaching it. At the last conference I spoke at, Venkat delivered a full day workshop on the first day and then gave a talk at literally every possible speaking slot over the course of the next 3 days, which totaled 13 separate 90 minute talks. The thing that amazes me even more (especially given my typical pre-talk routine) is he has no slides. He starts off each talk with some bullet point topics in a text editor and the magic happens from there.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>I tweet infrequently at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnriv?lang=en\">@JohnRiv</a>. In the middle of July I‚Äôll be at <a href=\"https://uberconf.com\">√úberConf</a> in Denver running a full-day workshop on Web Components and giving a couple talks in the days that follow.

Jaime has spoken at a lot of conferences, but like many of us, he‚Äôs applied at an order of magnitude more. Read on to learn more about his process and some of his suggestions for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ozbikNQ.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I‚Äôm Jaime Lopez Jr and I‚Äôm a software developer by day and a podcaster by night.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking because I wanted to reach a new audience where I could share my knowledge, experiences, and stories. I‚Äôve co-hosted a podcast (<a href=\"https://mtjc.fireside.fm/\">More Than Just Code</a>) for the past 4-5 years, so public speaking was a natural extension of that experience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like being able to share things that I have learned because I hope that my experiences can be helpful to others who encounter the same struggles that I have encountered.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has benefited my career by providing an opportunity to meet other people in the industry that I wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily get a chance to meet!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first conference talk. I co-presented a talk at 360iDev in Denver, Colorado with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timmitra\">Tim Mitra</a> (my friend and a co-host of More Than Just Code).</p>\n<p>The talk went very well from what I recall. The topic was about the way that hosting a technical podcast can help developers in their careers, which plays to our strengths as experienced podcasters. Of course it also helped that we had a few die-hard fans in the audience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Looking at my Google Sheets spreadsheet where I track this, I‚Äôve applied to about <strong>115 conferences in the past three years or so</strong>. I‚Äôve been accepted by 14 conferences and have spoken at (or am scheduled to speak at) 9 of those conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I like to find a quiet place to collect my thoughts about an hour prior to when I give my presentation. It certainly helps when there is a dedicated room for speakers to do this! Also, if possible I try to check out the room where I‚Äôll be speaking so I can get a sense of the acoustics as well as how the audience will experience the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>I generally try not to memorize my talks because it causes me to become robotic when speaking</strong>. Instead, I walk through the main points (generally a single word) that I want to mention related to my slides or code that I‚Äôm sharing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is one main piece of advice that I can give new speakers:</p>\n<p><strong>It is usually difficult to get started as a conference speaker in terms of getting your CFP submissions accepted. This is totally okay and you don‚Äôt need to worry about it!</strong></p>\n<p>I subscribed to the (now-defunct) <a href=\"https://techspeak.email/\">Technically Speaking newsletter</a> that was put together by Chiu-Ki Chan and Cate Huston. The content in that newsletter (which is still available online) helped me craft my CFP submissions so that there is a better chance of being accepted. As well, the Technically Speaking newsletter helped me feel better about CFP acceptance rates (which if I recall they said was somewhere about 10%).</p>\n<p>If I‚Äôve learned anything over the past few years of submitting to CFPs, <strong>it‚Äôs that it is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference</strong> (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP).</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers that come to mind.</p>\n<p>First is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/savinola\">Laura Savino</a>. The way she gives technical presentations makes the audience feel as if they‚Äôre going along on a shared journey. Each step of the way seems like a friend is sharing their favorite locations in an unfamiliar city.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkb9z68nhyo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Readable Code - Laura Savino - DDD Europe 2018</em></p>\n<p>Second is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nickolas Means</a>. I‚Äôve been impressed with the way that he can smoothly deliver stories that involve a lot of technical detail. The way he presents the topics at hand leaves the audience on the edge of their seat.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

Now, he‚Äôs\nbuilt a name for himself in the Ruby community as one of the top people in testing, and has spoken internationally at events\nof all sizes. I‚Äôve dealt with the problem of testing legacy systems before, so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTr0h4v-jHw\">I enjoyed Jason‚Äôs talk on the issue</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BkjG0j1.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I don‚Äôt remember exactly how or why I first got into public speaking. I believe my first tech talks were at small user groups in the Grand Rapids, Michigan tech community around 2010 or so. From there I got into guesting on podcasts, then hosting my own podcast, and then speaking at conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I have an altruistic reason and a selfish reason for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<p>The altruistic reason is that I can help a lot of people by speaking at conferences and sharing my message with attendees.</p>\n<p>The selfish reason is that speaking at conferences is a good way to boost my career prospects as a technology consultant. Since I‚Äôve only started speaking at conferences about six months ago, I think it‚Äôs too early to expect to see any tangible benefit from it yet. One way conference speaking has intangibly benefited me though is that I can now list in my bio that I‚Äôve spoken at certain conferences like RubyConf India which I think carries a lot of weight among my peers, and I can truthfully say that I‚Äôm an ‚Äúinternational speaker‚Äù.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at a regional conference called DevOpsDays Midwest in St. Louis, Missouri in September 2018. Since I had already been speaking at local user groups for years before that point, this speaking gig didn‚Äôt feel like too big of a jump up. I‚Äôm happy to say that as far as I can tell, the talk went fine.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to many dozens of conferences. I‚Äôve spoken at five conferences at the time of this interview with two more conference talks coming up, for a total of seven. I‚Äôve been accepted to more conferences than that but sometimes I can‚Äôt go because there‚Äôs a schedule conflict or the travel expense is too much to justify at the time.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have a pre-talk routine. I rehearse beforehand but on the day of the talk I just get up and do it.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I only have one piece of advice: If getting a talk proposal accepted seems like an unattainable goal, just keep sending in proposals and you‚Äôll probably eventually get something accepted.</p>\n<p>I had to submit dozens of proposals before I finally got a talk accepted, at least a talk at a conference I was able to attend. At this point I‚Äôve actually gotten more talks accepted than I can take on and I‚Äôve had to throttle back on sending in proposals. The act of giving my first talk gave me a couple ideas for my next talk. My next talk gave me several more ideas for future talks, and so on. The more I submitted proposals and the more I spoke, the easier it all got.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I think part of my motivation for speaking at conferences was seeing the success that my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlainChautard\">Alain Chautard</a> has had with it and seeing the impact speaking has had on his consulting career.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJwvmuK4tQw' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Alain Chautard at NG Conf 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

I got into public speaking at one of my previous jobs when we decided that our company should get more involved in the development community. So I started reading up on exactly how conferences decided on talks and started submitting to CFPs!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy all the people I‚Äôve been able to meet as a result of the speaking that I‚Äôve done. <strong>I especially enjoy chatting with people at the speaker dinners or other informal events surrounding the conference.</strong> As far as benefits to my career, some of these connections I‚Äôve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs, new clients and even (arguably) this interview.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at WordCamp Nashville in 2016. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/03/17/keanan-koppenhaver-take-wp-admin-to-the-next-level-with-advanced-custom-fields/\">video is actually online</a>, though I cringe watching it. It was a 20 minute ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù and I remember having to follow an awesome speaker who had the audience on the edge of their seat the entire time. The majority of my talk actually went well, but near the end (~14:00) you can see my heart jump up into my throat when one of my demos didn‚Äôt work correctly! Luckily, I was able to fix it and finish the talk, and <strong>this definitely wasn‚Äôt the last time demos didn‚Äôt work exactly right</strong>.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Between conferences and meetups, I‚Äôve probably spoken at between 20-30 and applied to probably twice that many. I don‚Äôt really apply to conferences that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd be a great fit for, but even then sometimes they just really can‚Äôt take everybody.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><em>Cue Eye of the Tiger montage‚Ä¶</em></p>\n<p>But seriously, I usually just try to get into the room I‚Äôll be speaking in before I have to give my talk (either by getting to the conference early in the morning or during lunch) and make sure my computer can interface with the projector and that the fonts on my slides are readable even in the back of the room.</p>\n<p><strong>I always try to attend the talk before mine in the same room</strong>, just so I can start setting up and doing a final check of everything as soon as the last presenter is done with their talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think there‚Äôs definitely lots of feelings from new speakers around not being knowledgeable enough to start speaking. <strong>But if a conference was only filled with super-advanced talks, they would lose a huge part of their audience.</strong> So, even if you just learned something, you can teach it and many attendees will welcome your perspective as a relatively-recent beginner. <strong>Since you just went through it all for the first time yourself, you know and remember all the roadblocks that someone getting started will have and can help them learn even quicker.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to that, the one thing that started really getting me more speaking opportunities is <strong>submitting multiple talks to each CFP</strong>. Conference organizers sometimes have an agenda of the talks they‚Äôre looking to accept and if you submit more talks, you give them more chances to fit you into the schedule they‚Äôre looking to craft. (However, some conferences specifically say to not submit more than X talks, so definitely abide by that.)</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really enjoy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garybernhardt\">Gary Bernhardt</a>, specifically <a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript\">Wat and The Birth and Death of Javascript</a> just because he manages to inject lots of humor into his talks while still keeping them super informative. I also loved <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en\">Tim Urban on Procrastination</a> just because of both his graphics and the way he walks the audience through his talk.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?
