How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>When I was in college, I was paralyzed by the fear of public speaking. Just the thought of talking in front of a small class would cause cold-sweats. Fortunately, I was studying for a career in Comp Sci. which usually doesn’t require much public speaking.</p>\n<p>Once my career began, I was reaffirmed, no one wants to hear a developer speak. That was fine for a few years, and then new nagging energy began. People can’t listen if you don’t speak. Quietly interjecting important points without ever taking the lead of a conversation is less effective than not speaking at all. It was time to start breaking out of my shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Though I was uncomfortable, I started speaking up more and more.</strong> I attended conferences, and I marveled at speakers. I was amazed, but sure I would never be on the other side of the 4th wall.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can’t shut me up. It’s always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn’t comfortable, but it’s doable. Now <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">you can see I’ve been speaking actively for years</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m very fortunate that I work for the great people at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a> who have supported me from lightning talk to keynote speaker.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>The best thing about speaking at conferences is the networking and connection. I’ve made friends around the world.</strong> This has, directly AND indirectly, benefited my career and employer. It’s not required in my job description, but it’s valuable to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>There’s something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts. I’m still an introvert, but it doesn’t matter who you are, something like that feels great. The community and positivity of it all is superb!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>After a lot of Toastmasters, and speaking at a local meetup, my first “conference” talk was a lightning slot at RubyConf 2013.</p>\n<p>How’d it go? Well, my heart was beating through my chest. But I gave a 30-minute presentation in 5 minutes after getting over my fear of public speaking, so there was no way to fail :)</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJOkpP__dY4?start=4829' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Gant Laborde at RubyConf, 2013</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>50+ and no stopping in sight!</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XfgC3IW.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde/status/1107007420763639808\">general rules for sure</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No dairy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\">Power Pose</a></li>\n<li>Think more about your audience than yourself</li>\n<li>Realize the audience wants you to succeed, and they can’t see that you’re nervous unless you tell them.</li>\n<li>They will feel what you feel.

Then it’s to fill a room, then get invited to speak, then keynote.</strong> The best speakers are people who have been leveling up for 20+ years, and they support and promote speakers who are just getting started. It’s not a zero-sum game, ask for help, get feedback, and improve. Then repeat. The best speakers aren’t born speakers.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Tejas Kumar has dealt with haemophilia his whole life, but despite his disease preventing him from completing a traditional computer science education, he’s used his self-taught knowledge and communication skills to achieve success as a developer. Now, as a tech conference speaker, he’s giving back to other developers by passing on what he knows. Looking through Tejas’ social profiles, you’ll see that he doesn’t take himself too seriously, but his informal, casual tone is part of what makes him a unique and interesting speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m Tejas. I love people and code and the conversations we have together. I’ve been a public speaker since a young age. I grew up with a fatal sickness (that I still have) where I couldn’t do much and I often felt like I’d never amount to much, so in some ways, I guess I’ve been drawn to public speaking to overcompensate. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MdV43uT.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like encouraging the community. I often learn things and I enjoy disseminating the information from stages and then having conversations about it later. <strong>Truth be told, I enjoy the private conversations that happen after a good talk <em>a lot</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>While it has directly benefited my career with a number of job offers, visibility, Twitter followers, all kinds of glitz and glam, the real value I see from this type of engagement is the love. I get to share hope with people, combat impostor syndrome, and see careers flourish; life change from a stage. It’s all very encouraging.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember doing a TEDx talk like 7 years ago. It was really well received. I think there was even a standing ovation. It was fun. 🙂</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUIcTl9Hto4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tejas presenting “Papercuts Can Kill” at TEDx</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I’ve applied to like 20 and spoken at like 9? It’s a gut feeling though. I have no real idea.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I often put myself into the mindset of “I’ve won” already before I even play.</strong> This gives me hope and like prepares me to do an amazing job. Eventually, it somehow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Odd, maybe, but it works for me every time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You’d be surprised by how much value you can add with a talk. Our tech industry today is so full of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1126096390281732097\">faux confidence and pretend knowledge</a> that one would often feel like they don’t know enough – I know I feel this way most of the time. The truth is, I actually know quite a bit <em>in my own, very specific area</em> that I can use to educate and help others who aren’t as familiar with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m often insecure about kubernetes, data structures and algorithms, and CS fundamentals because I personally was always too sick to get a Computer Science degree. I don’t have one. I am a prime example of impostor syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, I feel there are just as many people insecure about React, TypeScript, CSS and other areas. I rejoice at the idea of combating their impostor syndrome with my experience in these subjects. For me, this is part of the joy of public speaking along these themes.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been extremely uncomfortable with my <em>content</em> not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I’ve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to better my technical abilities to “close the loop”.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’ve been inspired by a lot of speakers, inside and outside of tech circles. I especially appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweststrate\">Michel Weststrate</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a>’s speaking styles as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darcar31\">Daria Caraway</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I’m most active on twitter under <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tejaskumar_\">@tejaskumar_</a>.

I think our first conversation was awkward nods in the hotel gym way too early before the conference, but once that was over, we got to talk throughout the conference.</p>\n<p>In addition to speaking, Matt is an active open source maintainer, and has been giving back to the PHP community in various ways for the past several years. He also speaks on behalf of <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">OSMI</a> - a great organization that helps raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech community - so I’m excited to present his journey into speaking and tips for those who are new to it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>During the day I’m a senior software engineer at a company called MoreCommerce where we do small and medium-sized business e-commerce and market place offerings. Outside of that, I help maintain various API related OSS projects like Fractal, openapi.tools, standards.rest and a few others. I spend most of my free time doing photography or cycling.</p>\n<p>As for speaking, I got my start at my old PHP user group in Atlanta. I started with a lightning talk and moved up to a full-length talk before breaking into a conference. Im usually pretty shy and quiet, so it was weird at first but it been a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about speaking is <strong>it’s an excuse to learn and play with new technology</strong>. I wouldn’t have become passionate about the OpenAPI spec if a conference hadn’t given me a chance to speak on it for example. And because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, <strong>giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn’t touch at work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It feels so long ago, but my first talk was at a now-defunct conference called “Great Wide Open”. I submitted a talk essentially about why community is awesome and how it can help someone learn. Since it was my first talk I was incredibly nervous but somehow I pulled it off. I got good feedback for it, and felt like I could have massaged it a bit into a more full talk.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>This year I will have spoken at 5, including 2 (maybe 3) keynotes. That’s the most I’ve ever done. Last year I spoke at one conference.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I usually put on some music, like Run The Jewels and just zone out.</strong> I tend not to sit in a talk before my slot so I can keep my thoughts going. Everyone is different, what works for me doesn’t mean it’ll work for someone else. I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing. I’m also bad in that I will still be doing slides up until my talk. I should fix that.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For your first talk, <strong>pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgable about.</strong> Don’t experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.</p>\n<p>When you submit your CFP, check your spelling and grammar. It’s amazing how many people overlook it.</p>\n<p>Another thing is <strong>don’t immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, submit multiple submissions, it gives you better odds. When we organized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/southeastphp\">Southeast PHP</a>, people with multiple submissions had a better shot getting into our post-apocalyptic Thunderdome over someone who only gave us one thing to choose.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I’m thrilled to bring you Drishti’s story today, and hope it inspires you to get out and do some good in the world!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w36pjbN.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I am Drishti Jain a Computer Engineer at heart and a technology enthusiast. I love to use technology to help the less fortunate. I am a social entrepreneur. I am the Co-founder and President of the non-profit organisation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samyakdrishtifoundation\">Samyak Drishti Foundation</a> which works in environment, education and healthcare sectors in 10 cities across India. I have been titled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoptimistcitizen/p/BdT0mVJnMhU/\">Eco-Warrior thrice by the Government of Maharashtra, India</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been a good orator since a young age. I got into public speaking at school in grade 4; when I had to give a speech on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (for his birth anniversary). Ever since, I’ve loved the stage and sharing knowledge with all. Fun Fact: I also host music concerts sometimes :)</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences about things that I am passionate about. While I continue to learn new things and develop myself, I like to share my learning with others. Speaking at conferences, I am sharing with everyone about how cool a technology is or how I make the most of a feature. It gives me immense satisfaction to share my knowledge with all.</p>\n<p>I have learnt a lot speaking at conferences. I would like to share my secret weapon to effectively speaking in front large audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>My secret weapon – the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause.</strong> These are three key parts of speaking effectively at conferences. Using this paradigm, I am able to more effectively deliver my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Moreover, speaking at conferences I am able to share my learning with all and give them a head start in the technology. I am believer of “Learning by sharing Knowledge” and speaking at conferences just fuels that!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was an exciting experience. Post deciding my topic (after a lot of brainstorming) I realized that I had just entered the long hiking trail of preparing my talk, yet to embark. There was a mountain of information I had gathered through research on the topic. And I had to create my talk in a way that I would cover maximum information and make it interesting. <strong>It all seemed overwhelming at first; but I decide to sit and create a summary of the information, that made it easy to prepare my talk.</strong></p>\n<p>On the day of the conference, I reached the venue early and checked if my laptop was compatible with the system; it was all ok and I was set to present my talk. Having reached early, I got comfortable with the environment and eagerly waited for my talk slot.</p>\n<p>I gave my talk and had a good Q and A for my talk; which gave me the assurance and satisfaction that I presented well and attendees were listening keenly.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing experience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Considering events, workshops, tech talks, conferences I have spoken at about 30-40; including a few virtual speaking engagements.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I attend the talk before my talk to set into the energy of the conference hall. <strong>I also do a demo practice with a friend to gain feedback.</strong></p>\n<p>I feel enthusiastic over nervous before my talk. I believe I have learned to convert my nervous energy into enthusiasm by practicing before my talk. I know it can be difficult due to packed schedules of the conference and work; but I do make sure to make time to practice. Sometimes I skim through my talk contents or rehearse the complete talk depending on the time I can make in my schedule.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I will encourage new speakers to speak about what they are truly passionate about. <strong>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present.</strong> It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!</p>\n<p>If you feel crunching everything you love about the topic into the 30/45 min talk is getting on to you, <strong>go outside and have fresh air. It will help you have a clear head and invoke creativity in your talk.</strong> It is very trivial to know the audience you will be presenting for. Most importantly remember to be yourself and be excited to share with the world what you like about the technology.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I got inspired by the talk by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pranavmistry\">Pranav Mistry</a> on the Sixth-Sense technology. I liked how he presented the technology and included components in the talk that could be understood by someone new in the technology space. It has inspired me to include an overview of concepts related to my topic in the beginning of my talk for a couple of minutes, so that a participant novice to the topic understands the overall picture and doesn’t feel left out.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrtANPtnhyg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>TEDIndia: The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology by Pranav Mistry</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am active on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drishtijjain\">@drishtijjain</a>.

What’s impressive to me is how quickly Kara has embraced her new career and been able to help others by giving talks at conferences and meetups. As Kara points out in this week’s Speaker’s Story, speaking is a great way to bolster your career and encourage others in the field.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into tech and eventually public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zFT1aBg.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I had a weird path to tech. I pursued a career as a professional ballerina for a long time. I even moved to New York City by myself at 17 to train full-time with the Joffrey Ballet School. I really loved ballet but I realized that I’d be lucky if I could make my career last until I was 30 due to all of the strain it puts on your body.</p>\n<p>That’s when I decided to take a break from ballet, move back to my hometown of Nashville, TN, and go to college. I majored in public relations with a music business minor and was one of the lucky few to land a job in the music industry after I graduated.</p>\n<p>I absolutely loved working as a music publicist. It was a very glamorous job but also a highly stressful one and I was getting burnt out pretty quickly. I knew I needed a change and started looking into other career paths when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">CodeCademy</a>. I really enjoyed the feeling of solving an error and decided that I wanted to make the leap to tech so I enrolled in The Iron Yard’s front end engineering bootcamp. Fast forward almost three years later and I’m still loving life in the tech world. I’m currently working as an engineer on the UX team at <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\">CrowdStrike</a>.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely benefited my career. It’s allowed me to expand my network in ways that I’ve never imagined before!</p>\n<p>I got into conference speaking first by writing blog posts which eventually led to speaking at local meetups and then conferences. I like that by speaking at conferences I can help others learn. <strong>It’s really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I’m talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn’t before.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I gave my first conference talk not too long ago! Big shout out to CodeStock for allowing me the opportunity. I’m really happy with the way my talk turned out. I talk fast naturally and talk even faster when I’m nervous so I was worried that my 60-minute time slot would end up being closer to 20 minutes. I took my time and a couple deep breaths and managed to use up most of my allotted time though!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’m still pretty new to the speaker circuit so I’ve only applied to around eight conferences. I’ve spoken at one so far and am currently on the waitlist for another. <strong>I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. I’m learning from each rejection I get.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don’t like to attend a session before my talk as I like to take that time to be by myself and compose my thoughts. I’ll typically run through my slides one last time but I’ll only do a visual run through - I won’t actually practice. I also like to take a minute or two to go somewhere on my own and give myself a little pep talk!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Go for it! You can never succeed if you don’t try.</strong> Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and don’t give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really love watching Chloe Condon’s talks.
