At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>While Bailey has been practicing public speaking her whole life, she was drawn to speak at tech conferences after seeing so many design and development teams struggle to put their message online. One thing I love about speaking is getting to attend conferences and hear other talks - especially from subject-matter experts who are truly passionate about their craft. Bailey is one of those passionate people, and I‚Äôm excited to bring you her story here today.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm director of content strategy at usability consulting firm <a href=\"https://truematter.com/\">truematter</a> out of Columbia, South Carolina. I‚Äôm a user experience content strategist which means I plan, organize, and write the words people use to interact with websites, applications, and software products. I‚Äôve been involved in public speaking throughout my life, especially when I was younger.</p>\n<p>Recently, I felt a call to pick it up again for many reasons but one in particular: design and development teams must change their approach to words online. Many, many organizations (including those that should know better) still write their online content the same way they would for traditional media. That approach drags down their product‚Äôs user experience, makes it harder for customers to engage with them online, and has a large negative impact on the success of their digital products. I set out to speak out about this widespread problem and how we should fix it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l6UnYFz.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm still pretty new on the conference scene but even so, <strong>I‚Äôve already made a lot of connections with both people in my field and those outside of it.</strong> I think it‚Äôs a lot easier to meet people when you‚Äôre the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time ‚Äì a real plus for an introvert like me.</p>\n<p>Also, I‚Äôve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places ‚Äì I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It went well! I think I was surprised when I found out that people do actually care a great deal about their digital content and want to know how to make it better and more usable. The audience had a ton of questions, which was great. The whole thing is kind of addicting. You experience it once and think, ‚ÄúI want to do that again.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve spoken at about ten events so far with another four or five already scheduled for later this year.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to a lot more than that for sure. I probably send out three applications a month and that number has been growing lately. But <strong>the more I apply and the more I speak, the more conferences are approaching me instead of the other way around and that‚Äôs a really nice feeling.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATVKZdl_pEw?start=130' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Bailey Lewis at OKC Design Tech</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I always try to see the space before I speak in it. That could mean swinging by the room before my presentation or trying to find a video of a presentation someone else gave in that room online. Seeing the space before my presentation lets me decide where to stand and helps me understand how the audience will be looking at my slides (one big screen? multiple screens around the room? etc).</p>\n<p>Other than that, <strong>I take a deep breath and remind myself: The audience came to see me present on this topic.</strong> They want it to go well as much as I do. And that‚Äôs a lot more helpful than imagining them in their underwear.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>If you‚Äôre brand new, it might be hard to find speaking gigs that will cover your travel and accommodations. The conference might even ask you to pay to attend even though you‚Äôre speaking (not my favorite practice but there you have it).</p>\n<p>Take a few of these gigs if you need to so you can get started and get your name out there, but as soon as someone offers to cover your travel/accommodations, demand it every time you speak afterward. Even better if you can throw a speaker stipend into the mix. That will probably mean saying no to conferences you‚Äôd really like to speak at, which can be painful. But once you reach certain level in your speaking career, you shouldn‚Äôt be digging in your own pockets when you‚Äôre the one providing the presentation content that will sell conference tickets and make the event successful.</p>\n<p>By the way, <strong>I love that CFP Land lists which ‚Äúperks‚Äù each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don‚Äôt have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I‚Äôm expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.</strong></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure about specific conference speakers (although there are presentations I‚Äôve really enjoyed), but my father is a trial attorney and, among other speaking-related lessons, he taught me the art of giving a presentation without swaying or fidgeting. He would record me giving a presentation and then have me watch it back ‚Äì it was extremely effective for getting rid of the fidgets.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Find me at <a href=\"https://truematter.com/baileylewis\">truematter.com/baileylewis</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>When I was in college, I was paralyzed by the fear of public speaking. Just the thought of talking in front of a small class would cause cold-sweats. Fortunately, I was studying for a career in Comp Sci. which usually doesn‚Äôt require much public speaking.</p>\n<p>Once my career began, I was reaffirmed, no one wants to hear a developer speak. That was fine for a few years, and then new nagging energy began. People can‚Äôt listen if you don‚Äôt speak. Quietly interjecting important points without ever taking the lead of a conversation is less effective than not speaking at all. It was time to start breaking out of my shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Though I was uncomfortable, I started speaking up more and more.</strong> I attended conferences, and I marveled at speakers. I was amazed, but sure I would never be on the other side of the 4th wall.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can‚Äôt shut me up. It‚Äôs always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn‚Äôt comfortable, but it‚Äôs doable. Now <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">you can see I‚Äôve been speaking actively for years</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm very fortunate that I work for the great people at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a> who have supported me from lightning talk to keynote speaker.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>The best thing about speaking at conferences is the networking and connection. I‚Äôve made friends around the world.</strong> This has, directly AND indirectly, benefited my career and employer. It‚Äôs not required in my job description, but it‚Äôs valuable to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts. I‚Äôm still an introvert, but it doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, something like that feels great. The community and positivity of it all is superb!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>After a lot of Toastmasters, and speaking at a local meetup, my first ‚Äúconference‚Äù talk was a lightning slot at RubyConf 2013.</p>\n<p>How‚Äôd it go? Well, my heart was beating through my chest. But I gave a 30-minute presentation in 5 minutes after getting over my fear of public speaking, so there was no way to fail :)</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJOkpP__dY4?start=4829' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Gant Laborde at RubyConf, 2013</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>50+ and no stopping in sight!</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XfgC3IW.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde/status/1107007420763639808\">general rules for sure</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No dairy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are\">Power Pose</a></li>\n<li>Think more about your audience than yourself</li>\n<li>Realize the audience wants you to succeed, and they can‚Äôt see that you‚Äôre nervous unless you tell them.</li>\n<li>They will feel what you feel. So üòÉ (smile)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You‚Äôre not done and you‚Äôre not stuck. <strong>For a lot of people, level 1 was just speaking. Then it‚Äôs to speak well. Then it‚Äôs to fill a room, then get invited to speak, then keynote.</strong> The best speakers are people who have been leveling up for 20+ years, and they support and promote speakers who are just getting started. It‚Äôs not a zero-sum game, ask for help, get feedback, and improve. Then repeat. The best speakers aren‚Äôt born speakers.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I LOVE TED TALKS! <a href=\"https://medium.com/@gantlaborde/5-ted-talks-that-changed-me-4aa0cec43d79\">Here‚Äôs 5 that have made me recontextualize life</a>.</p>\n<p>As for Tech, I‚Äôd say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jevakallio\">Jani Evakallio</a> has been amazing every talk I see.

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Tejas Kumar has dealt with haemophilia his whole life, but despite his disease preventing him from completing a traditional computer science education, he‚Äôs used his self-taught knowledge and communication skills to achieve success as a developer. Now, as a tech conference speaker, he‚Äôs giving back to other developers by passing on what he knows. Looking through Tejas‚Äô social profiles, you‚Äôll see that he doesn‚Äôt take himself too seriously, but his informal, casual tone is part of what makes him a unique and interesting speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Tejas. I love people and code and the conversations we have together. I‚Äôve been a public speaker since a young age. I grew up with a fatal sickness (that I still have) where I couldn‚Äôt do much and I often felt like I‚Äôd never amount to much, so in some ways, I guess I‚Äôve been drawn to public speaking to overcompensate. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MdV43uT.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like encouraging the community. I often learn things and I enjoy disseminating the information from stages and then having conversations about it later. <strong>Truth be told, I enjoy the private conversations that happen after a good talk <em>a lot</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>While it has directly benefited my career with a number of job offers, visibility, Twitter followers, all kinds of glitz and glam, the real value I see from this type of engagement is the love. I get to share hope with people, combat impostor syndrome, and see careers flourish; life change from a stage. It‚Äôs all very encouraging.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember doing a TEDx talk like 7 years ago. It was really well received. I think there was even a standing ovation. It was fun. üôÇ</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUIcTl9Hto4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tejas presenting ‚ÄúPapercuts Can Kill‚Äù at TEDx</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I‚Äôve applied to like 20 and spoken at like 9? It‚Äôs a gut feeling though. I have no real idea.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I often put myself into the mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve won‚Äù already before I even play.</strong> This gives me hope and like prepares me to do an amazing job. Eventually, it somehow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Odd, maybe, but it works for me every time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You‚Äôd be surprised by how much value you can add with a talk. Our tech industry today is so full of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1126096390281732097\">faux confidence and pretend knowledge</a> that one would often feel like they don‚Äôt know enough ‚Äì I know I feel this way most of the time. The truth is, I actually know quite a bit <em>in my own, very specific area</em> that I can use to educate and help others who aren‚Äôt as familiar with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôm often insecure about kubernetes, data structures and algorithms, and CS fundamentals because I personally was always too sick to get a Computer Science degree. I don‚Äôt have one. I am a prime example of impostor syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, I feel there are just as many people insecure about React, TypeScript, CSS and other areas. I rejoice at the idea of combating their impostor syndrome with my experience in these subjects. For me, this is part of the joy of public speaking along these themes.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve always been extremely uncomfortable with my <em>content</em> not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I‚Äôve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to better my technical abilities to ‚Äúclose the loop‚Äù.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been inspired by a lot of speakers, inside and outside of tech circles. I especially appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweststrate\">Michel Weststrate</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a>‚Äôs speaking styles as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darcar31\">Daria Caraway</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm most active on twitter under <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tejaskumar_\">@tejaskumar_</a>.
