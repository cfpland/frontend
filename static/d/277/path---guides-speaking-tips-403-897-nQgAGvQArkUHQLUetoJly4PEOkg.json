I was so shy and scared of public speaking. I never, ever thought I’d be speaking at conferences one day.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/</a></li>\n<li>“I don’t think I slept for three days before my first talk. One of the reasons I enjoy giving talks is that I get to work on my fear of speaking in front of crowds. That said, I always struggle right before I actually get on stage.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-joe-mastey/\">Joe Mastey</a></li>\n<li>“the intense rush of adrenaline and nerves before you get on stage is COMPLETELY NORMAL and it happens to everyone, even people who’ve been doing it for years.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fake it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“If anyone asks me about how I’m feeling I tell them “excited!” Even if I’m actually totally nervous, I find that embodying excitement helps me feel that way.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/</a></li>\n<li>“You were chosen for a reason. Trust that.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most people in the audience would be terrified to do what you’re doing, and they respect that.</p>\n<p>Memorize the first 2 minutes of your talk cold, because it’s easier once you get rolling.” - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wiredferret\">https://twitter.com/wiredferret</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Do more speaking in other venues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I’d definitely recommend panels as a gateway experience for anyone who is considering branching out into public speaking.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/\">Laura Janusek</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Stand up (not optional) and practice out loud. If you screw something up, do not stop. You won’t get to repeat the whole talk on stage so having those prep sessions at home will make you well prepared to any mishap that might happen on stage.” - <a href=\"https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp\">https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp</a></li>\n<li>“Local user group meetups are always looking for speakers so if you approach them you will rarely hear a, ‘no.’” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-geshan-manandhar/\">Geshan Manandhar</a></li>\n<li>““practice”. No one did great the first time they got on stage or the second one, but practice makes perfect. So look at your presentations, identify the areas you could have done better (be it slides, content, posture, delivery), and then find the next conference or meetup where you can practice your talk some more and improve on those points.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/\">Alex Lakatos</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be ready early</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I always try to attend the talk before mine in the same room, just so I can start setting up and doing a final check of everything as soon as the last presenter is done with their talk.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“I personally think it’s better to shorten one’s talk in order to receive questions, than to deliver everything and have no time for them. However, note that is very dependent on conference country’s culture.” - <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“double the speakers means double the cost. To be transparent, we do hold applications with multiple speakers to a higher standard during our evaluation.” - <a href=\"https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260\">https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Before you submit a proposal on a topic, consider writing a blog post about it. If you were able to say everything you wanted to in 1 post, then it’s probably not a good candidate for a talk. Written words work well for reference and getting started, materials, and for comprehensive rundowns. Talks on the other hand favor emotional communication. What is the story behind this refactoring? Are you taking a boring topic and making it interesting or memorable somehow in a way that only a live performance could do justice to?” - <a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Instead of simply stating opinions or facts (e.g. “React is the most popular JavaScript library”) as well as revealing all of your cards instantaneously, tell a story.” - <a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Advanced Tips</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pumping up</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Start with local community events. They’re easier to get to than major conferences and you’ll get your first experiences as a public speaker in a more comfortable setting. Those kinds of events are often recorded, which is a valuable addition to your CFP.” - <a href=\"https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp\">https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp</a></li>\n<li>“I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won (dunno what, but the point is I’m a winner now!): pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few “Hell yeah!“s if I think the toilet it empty (spoiler alert: it rarely is as empty as I think). That makes me think I just won something, I don’t need to win on stage as well, and it calms my nerves enough so I don’t shake as I speak.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/\">Alex Lakatos</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gather feedback</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Record Yourself</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep an open mind</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I think it’s a shame when speakers come in just for their session and then leave. I make it a point to support and learn from the other speakers when I’m at a conference, so my session is usually one of many that I participate in throughout the day.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/\">Laura Janusek</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“1.

Remove everything that’s not content.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain it the way you would explain it to a friend in a bar with a napkin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Slides constrain you. They are crutches. Do it without, then add a few if necessary.” - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes\">https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Questions or no questions?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Don’t feel like you need to take questions at the end of your talk either. Some people are comfortable w/ it. Others aren’t. Totally cool if you decide to just end it without questions.” - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/byronwoodfork\">https://twitter.com/byronwoodfork</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wear comfortable shoes to present in, and wear them while practicing, so you build the postural memory.\nEat 1 hour before, pee 15 minutes before you’re scheduled.\nPractice out loud, to get used to hearing your voice, and to manage any tongue twisters before hand.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CZEdwards\">https://twitter.com/CZEdwards</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If doing demos, have a video of them, just in case (conf wifi sucks!)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I generally try not to memorize my talks because it causes me to become robotic when speaking. Instead, I walk through the main points (generally a single word) that I want to mention related to my slides or code that I’m sharing.\n<a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/\">Jaime Lopez</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“make sure you start off smiling 😃” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“During the intro of your talk, let the audience know how you intend to take questions (raise your hand during the talk, hold them until the end, chat in the hallway later, email, etc.). If someone asks a question that you don’t know the answer to, it is much better to say “That is a great question. I don’t know what the answer is so let me get back to you,” than to try to make up an answer on the spot.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Watch technical conference talks, and also watch talks in other fields like TED that are captivating. What makes them good?” - <a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“When you are stressed, you’ll probably talk faster than intended, and even skip some parts of your talk. Hence, you should plan for that, and plan for more content than the expected talk duration.” - <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“there always is a handful of people who are nodding or smiling during your talk. Try to focus on them specifically, as this brings you positive reinforcement, and help you stay “in the zone”.” - <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Just because the allocated time slot has been passed doesn’t mean you’re done. You should stay in the room for a little while, to allow people who had no time to ask their questions - or those who were to shy - to come to talk with you. Just be considerate to the next speaker and remove your stuff so he can start preparing his set: nothing is worse than a speaker that continues monopolizing the stage after his allotted timeframe.” - <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Some jokes that send the whole audience to laughter in some countries could likely be considered inappropriate - or even offensive - in others. If you’re not sure whether a specific comment/joke is appropriate for your audience, just don’t try.” - <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Go for it! You can never succeed if you don’t try. Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and don’t give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-kara-luton/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-kara-luton/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“My secret weapon – the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-drishti-jain/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-drishti-jain/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can’t shut me up. It’s always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn’t comfortable, but it’s doable.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Think more about your audience than yourself” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“Realize the audience wants you to succeed, and they can’t see that you’re nervous unless you tell them.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“They will feel what you feel.

You will not get a feel for your talk by practicing it “in your head”.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“do not be the person that edits your presentation hours/minutes leading up to your talk.

I’ve seen some technical talks derailed because the presenter spent too long trying to get a code example to work, or wait for a file to load due to a bad internet connection. If something is not going correct, move on to the next part of your talk, your audience will thank you.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“make your talk interactive.

Organizing conferences is hard and usually being done for free as a labor of love. Being a diva because you can’t get a certain type of water will definitely get you on the do-not-invite-back list.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-jc-hiatt/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-jc-hiatt/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“It’s ok to be a bit nervous, but try to understand that if you have been chosen to give a talk at a conference or at a local meetup it’s because you’re an expert in that field, so you know what you’re talking about.” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-adrian-bolonio/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-adrian-bolonio/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“if you’re a new speaker, you probably are more experienced than you realize if your job requires you to do a lot of communication (even if it’s just in small team meetings or Slack conversations).” - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>“I think to get less represented people on stage, we really need to just ask them more.
