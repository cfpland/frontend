Kirk Pepperdine sold the company he founded\nto Microsoft, and now helps build the Java experience for Azure.</p>\n<p>Kirk has spoken at countless conferences (as evidenced by his trove of event badges), and is currently talking about performance\ntuning for Java. In his interview below, he talks about his current work, how he has built up a workshop over years, and what he’s learned about what people expect out of conference speakers. Read on for more of Kirk’s story.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. What’s your job and how did you get into speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PzxbxD-GRJu4Z3fp-tV5whC-y6POyS9D\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I’m a principle engineer at Microsoft. This all came about as a result of Microsoft acquiring jClarity, a small performance tooling company that I co-founded. Microsoft was looking to build a team of Java experts to help them create the best experience possible for Java in Azure. Plus, Microsoft owns a surprising number of Java assets so adding more Java expertise makes sense. I’m very humbled to be part of a groundbreaking team inside Microsoft. Right now we’re tuning a number of internal applications as well as continuing to build out performance diagnostic tooling that we were developing at jClarity.</p>\n<p>As for side projects, I’m picking at a few ideas in the performance tooling and diagnostic space at the moment. Difficult to say what will see the light of day at the moment but I expect at least one of them will be released sometime this year.</p>\n<p>And there is always <a href=\"https://www.jcrete.org/\">jCrete</a>, an unconference that I cofounded with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heinzkabutz\">Dr. Heinz Kabutz</a>. I don’t know how, but we’ve managed to create an environment that has attracted a significant number of the most notable names in the Java space. It’s been very satisfying to watch people come to jCrete, be inspired by the incredible amount of talent and then take that energy and create things with it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jitwatch\">JITWatch</a> is an amazing tool that was inspired by Chris Newland’s understanding of some of the compiler people that he was speaking to. Even more satisfying was watching some of the kids who were tagging along with mum or dad to the conference gain interest in what was going on to the point where they’d start participating. At least one of the kids took the ideas from jCrete back to her high school and setup an unconference there for a completely un-IT subject.</p>\n<p>That brings me back to the point, when we invite a person to attend jCrete, we don’t only invite the person, we have invited his or her’s family or partner whom are perfectly accepted to attend sessions. In a few cases we’ve had spouses and partners propose and lead sessions on topics related to their profession that has relevance to our everyday lives. Having spouses, partners, kids all about creates an amazing atmosphere which is surprisingly beneficial for learning and sharing experiences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like sharing knowledge. To have the chance to share something that may help make a developers life easier or help them better understand how something works is very fulfilling. It’s also a great time to connect with people, attendees and other speakers to talk tech, toss around ideas, and see the progress others have made on their pet projects.</p>\n<h3>What makes Java performance tuning such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>To be honest, early on in my career I was not interested performance tuning. I just became the “goto” guy because I was perceived as having some knack of seeing the source of performance problems and so people kept coming to me when they had issues and I just kept solving them.</p>\n<p>This is how I came to work with Jack Shirazi. We were working together on a project in a bank and after a disastrous false start, management came to Jack and myself and assigned us the glorious task of tuning it. Jack took the experience and our notes to write Java Performance Tuning which was a perennial best seller for O’Reilly for the longest time. Jack then started <a href=\"http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/\">the companion site (www.javaperformancetuning.com)</a> where I helped him launch. Afterwards we worked together to get the first version of a performance tuning workshop together and before we were ready, people started asking for it. After launch I continued on with the workshop and it’s been a living work in progress ever since.</p>\n<p>A big part of maintaining and evolving the workshop has been, how can I better describe this point so that I can get a better success rate when people try it out on life like problems.</p>\n<p>From this and my consulting practice I eventually formed the seals of a performance diagnostic process. This immediately had an effect on attendees. I had a tuning exercise that took a couple of hours each day over the 4 days to work through. After I introduced the methodology I started seeing attendees complete the entire exercise in 2 to 3 hours.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing productivity boost. Even better were the emails I’d get after the workshop ended. People were telling me that they were able to solve long standing nagging problems in minutes. It’s funny but when people try to customize the workshop for their own companies “special” needs they almost always want do drop the methodology section. I never let them do that. It is my opinion that the methodology is the <em>most</em> important topic of the workshop and the final exercises are there just to deepen the understanding of that process.</p>\n<p>I’m not going to claim that my methodology is a silver bullet and there isn’t any other way to tune. Certainly there are others in the industry such as Branden Gregg that has a well thought out methodology. And of course there are others such as Heinz Kabutz, Peter Lawrey, Martin Thompson, Charlie Hunt, Monica Beckwith, Todd Montgomery, Cliff Click, Gil Tene and of course Jack Shirazi and others that I’ve taken inspiration from that have a lot to say on the subject.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at one of the first Devoxx. Jack and I had a two hour session. I remember the room was pretty big and pretty full. <strong>I remember being very nervous about the entire thing and I was very happy when it was over.</strong> I remember the immediate feedback was friendly but I’d have to say that the materials have matured considerably since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’ve no idea as I’ve completely lost track. I did keep all of the conference badges. Here’s a picture of some of them:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1slhdy-kQPgrV7SKJ3P8NdxjTc32eis5V\" alt=\"Conference Badges\"></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Good question, I guess I do. After getting wired up…If there is someone in the audience that I know I’ll sit with them and just talk about nothing in particular. Otherwise I generally just try to clear my mind and relax.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>We generally always have a a session at <a href=\"https://www.jcrete.org/\">jCrete</a> about becoming a better speaker.</p>\n<p>From the years of attending these the common conclusion is <strong>people like stories, they like to be entertained and most importantly they are there to learn something that is relevant to their day to day existence as a developer.</strong> If you can combine all of these elements into a talk then you’re generally going to be well received and the talk will be memorable.</p>\n<p>For effects, I use diagrams in favor of words, single words instead of walls of text, blank slides when the audience should be focusing on your voice and not be distracted reading a wall of text. When you believe your slide deck is finished, that is the time to start thinking about presentation and how the material fits onto the slides and what can be done to improve the visual aspects of the talk. In my experience, Audiences tend to respond well to desks that say, I cared enough to take the extra time to make this visual appealing.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There is a long list of speakers that I look up to for many different reasons. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heinzkabutz\">Dr. Heinz Kabutz</a> for his mastery of his subject matter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Dr. Venkat Subramaniam</a> for his ability to take an audience on amazing journeys, Adam Bien one of the original live coders, Josh Long, amazing energy and his ability to project it onto the audience, Ted Neward, Cameron Prudy, and the list goes on and on.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://gotochgo.com/2020/speakers/1323/kirk-pepperdine\">Kirk Pepperdine and his upcoming talk at GOTO Chicago here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.

I wanted to offer a little update on how I’m handling things\nwith CFP Land, and what the current recommendations are for people like us who speak at conferences.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>The CFP Land Newsletter Will Continue Weekly Publication</h2>\n<p>First, I am fortunate to have a job that can be done remotely, so my day-to-day schedule won’t change too much. I’ll continue\npreparing and publishing the CFP Land newsletter every week unless I (or someone in my family) gets seriously sick.</p>\n<p>Second, I will update any conferences I hear of that cancel their events, but I could use your help with this. I’m not on every\nevent’s mailing list, so if you see a conference on CFP Land that you know is no longer going to happen, please let me know\nusing the “Report an Issue” link on the CFP:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/report.gif\" alt=\"Report issues on CFP Land\"></p>\n<p>As always, I’m also available by email at <code class=\"language-text\">info@cfpland.com</code>.</p>\n<h2>Consider Preemptively Canceling Any In-Person Events You’re Planning on Attending</h2>\n<p>Seriously, <a href=\"https://trackcorona.herokuapp.com/map\">this thing is global</a>, and probably going to get worse before it gets better.\n<a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/covid-19-what-is-social-distancing-and-how-to-do-it-properly\">Social distancing is the best way to slow its spread</a>, so I can’t imagine many tech conferences are important enough to go to at the risk of thousands of peoples’ lives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/posts/covid-map.png\" alt=\"Global Covid 19 Map\"></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you could offer to give any scheduled talks virtually, or as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philnash/status/1238235174829060096\">Phil Nash</a> is doing, you could switch to live-streaming\nsome coding sessions instead.</p>\n<h2>This Won’t Last Forever</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the rush of fear, but I’m an optimist, so I don’t believe this is the end of society as we know it.\nIn a few weeks or months, we’ll all start returning to normal life, and those of us who attend and speak at conferences will likely\nbe back at it. Many conferences scheduled for the Fall are opening their CFPs now, so you might want to continue applying, even if this summer’s events end up changed.</p>\n<p>We also might see a rise in virtual events, which will be pretty cool. While I believe there’s no substitute for actual human contact, virtual events are cheaper, more carbon-friendly, and more accessible to people in developing countries. They provide\na lot of benefits, and those of us lucky enough to be in major tech hubs would do well to remember that.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, and thanks for reading!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"A CFP Land Covid 19 Update","path":"/blog/covid-19/","category":"Updates","tags":["Covid 19","Service Interruptions"],"date":"2020/03/14","image":"/img/posts/covid-map.png"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>I recently mentioned on a podcast <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/career-advancement-through-public-speaking-karl-hughes\">that Twilio was my favorite Developer Relations team</a>, so when Phil Nash of Twilio <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/2020/01/29/how-to-find-cfps-for-developer-conferences/\">mentioned CFP Land</a> in a blog post he wrote, I knew I wanted to get his story up here.</p>\n<p>As many conference speakers do, Phil has a passion for teaching people and sharing his knowledge.

What’s your job and how did you get into speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1G9YoZUE9RJzUMGKuzwOhqW82nek6qNsj\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is Phil Nash and I am a Developer Evangelist for <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com\">Twilio</a>. I like working with Ruby, JavaScript and anything on the web platform. As an evangelist I spend my days working on example applications, building tools to help developers, and on writing blog posts, documentation and talks.</p>\n<p>Before evangelism I worked as a developer in London in an agency and product studio called <a href=\"https://mintdigital.com/\">Mint Digital</a>, which gave me the chance to work across a number of different styles of project. That was also where I was encouraged to get into public speaking, the company had a great policy that let us attend 2 conferences a year and would support us for more if we got accepted to speak. I seized that opportunity and it led to a few speaking engagements in European conferences, and eventually to this role in evangelism.</p>\n<p>On the side I like <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/\">blogging on my own site</a> and maintaining <a href=\"https://github.com/philnash?tab=repositories\">a bunch of open source applications, rubygems and node modules</a>. I’m also a Google Developer Expert, a <a href=\"https://untappd.com/user/philnash\">lover of beer</a> and now living in Melbourne, Australia.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has absolutely had a direct benefit to my career, it is part of my career now, but that doesn’t stop it being fun too. Something I realised as I started my evangelism career was that <strong>I enjoy speaking because I enjoy teaching people, showing them new things or new ways to achieve something</strong>. Breaking down topics, giving them my spin and hopefully making it entertaining along the way has become a passion.</p>\n<p>That’s what I love about the speaking side of things, but attending conferences in general has led to meeting so many kind, intelligent, community minded people that the best part of speaking is being able to do this more. Anyone can go to a conference and meet people, but if you speak it becomes a lot easier. Most people get a lot out of conferences because they get to listen to and learn from the experiences of those on stage. The real benefits lie in making connections with and learning from the experiences of as many people in the audience too.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I love talking about advancing the web platform. When I got into development professionally the number of features we had available to us to build experiences on the web were very few. The power of things like WebRTC, service workers, speech recognition and push notifications expand the amazing things we can build on the web. I like to experiment with these features and hopefully inspire others to use them in new and interesting ways.</p>\n<p>I also like picking up things that aren’t well understood and going in a bit deeper on them. I did this for two factor authentication, initially wanting to find out exactly how a website and a mobile app could agree on a 6 digit code, and building that into an experience.</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>I just like talking about things I’ve worked on. They tend to be things I’m passionate about and while the audience may learn about that particular project</strong>, I hope they also take away things they can use in their own projects too.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?</h3>\n<p>It seems that my first conference talk is now confined to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160809165416/http://devslovebacon.com/conferences/bacon-2012/talks/html5-takes-over-the-world\">the Wayback Machine</a>. It was a talk called “HTML5 takes over the world” and was about all the fancy new features of the web back in 2012, including an experimental build of the Opera browser that had the first implementation of <code class=\"language-text\">getUserMedia</code> for getting access to a user’s camera and microphone.</p>\n<p>I remember being very nervous and drinking 3 cups of coffee before getting on stage. <strong>I had a half hour slot for the talk and I stormed through the talk, I think I finished in around 17 minutes and out of breath.</strong> I remember being happy with what I said, but a bit taken aback by the performance itself. At least we had plenty of time for questions.</p>\n<p>To this day I won’t have more than one cup of coffee before getting on stage in case I set myself speaking at double speed again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>After a quick count through my <a href=\"https://philna.sh/speaking/history\">speaking history</a>, it looks as though I’ve spoken at between 70 and 80 conferences since 2012. I’ve applied to so many more though, it’s not even funny. <strong>I must have sent in hundreds of proposals and been rejected hundreds of times too.</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve learned not to take that to heart as each conference organiser or CFP committee member has a different view on the talks they want to see at their event. <strong>A talk may be wrong for once conference and right for another</strong>, which is why it is worth finding the open CFPs and finding the right conference for your talk.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I think my pre-talk routine mostly consists of pacing around and going through the talk in my head. And not drinking too much coffee.</p>\n<p>I still get nervous before crowds, particularly if it’s the first outing of a talk. I don’t think that will ever go away fully, so I embrace it. I don’t have rituals or anything that makes it better so I just try to use the nervous energy to my advantage.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Every person that gets on a stage to give a talk to an audience is up there telling their story and if you want to give a talk on something you need to find your angle on it. When you include your experiences it makes your talk unique. <strong>I could happily watch presentations on the same piece of code by 10 different people because I bet I would learn something new from each of them.</strong> You are the world’s foremost expert on your own experiences, and I believe that needs to come across in your presentation. That way you can’t be an imposter because no-one else has had your experience.</p>\n<p>When it comes to finding conferences to apply to, I recently wrote up a <a href=\"https://philna.sh/blog/2020/01/29/how-to-find-cfps-for-developer-conferences/\">list of different sites and mailing lists you can use to keep up to date with open CFPs</a> (including <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a> of course).</p>\n<p><strong>The most important thing for giving talks is to practice, out loud.</strong> You don’t need to have an audience to practice to, but running through the slides and saying the words you want to say out loud will stick them in your head much better for when you come to say them in front of other people. Nothing can substitute rehearsal for ensuring you are prepared when it comes time to speak.</p>\n<p>If you are speaking at a conference, I’d recommend giving your talk to a local meet-up first too. That way you can get a good gauge on what the audience thinks of it, anything useful you might have missed and what the questions might be. It also forces you to practice at least once before you get to the conference.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Oh so many people. I’ve been fortunate to have been at so many conferences and seen so many speakers that I have inspiration all around. I already know I’m forgetting so many people as I write this following list, but here’s some fantastic people off the top of my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All my fellow (and former) developer evangelist colleagues at Twilio, they both inspire me and also challenge me to improve all the time</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie\">Charlie Gerard</a> for her amazing side projects leading to AI and web powered live demos</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> for her ability to break down the most complicated parts of CSS and make anyone understand</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tenderlove\">Aaron Patterson</a> for taking the deepest of dives into how Ruby works but doing so in a flurry of puns</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/erinjzimmer\">Erin Zimmer</a> for digging into browsers, Angular and web components and making them accessible to all</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And many, many more.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers</h3>\n<p>You can find me almost anywhere on the internet as <em>philnash</em>, from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philnash\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/philnash\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/philnash/\">LinkedIn</a> to my own site, <a href=\"https://philna.sh\">philna.sh</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m also streaming <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/phil_nash/\">live coding on Twitch frequently</a>, so come say “Hi! 👋” sometime!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests.
