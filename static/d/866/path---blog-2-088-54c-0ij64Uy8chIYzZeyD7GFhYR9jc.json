How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rNiq6xr.png?1\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://crate.io/\">Crate.io</a> which means I am working closely with the community of engineers using CrateDB. I am speaking at a lot at conferences, holding webinars, writing tutorials and articles. I got into public speaking after joining a program called <a href=\"https://events.mozilla.org/techspeakers\">Mozilla Tech Speakers</a>. I gave my first talk in 2016 in Russia.</p>\n<p>I have been going to conferences for a while now and I have met some truly amazing speakers from whom I have learnt a lot. I thought, why not record our conversations and make them available as a podcast so that a lot more people can benefit from it? This is a side project that is very dear to me on which I am concentrating on these days. It is called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">Technically True</a> and I chat with inspiring people in the industry to gain insights on topics related to public speaking and developer relations.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Initially, one of the strongest incentives was travelling to new places. Over time, the thing I liked the most about this was meeting new developer communities, engaging with them and of course, speaking and sharing what I have been working on.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences helped me gain more exposure and until the end of 2018, it was something that I did just for fun. Then I realised that I used up almost all of my vacation days for speaking at conferences and that now maybe it is time that I should do this full-time. That is when I decided to quit my job and join Crate.io this year as a full-time Developer Advocate. It‚Äôs been almost a year that speaking has been a part of my daily work and I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>These days, I have been speaking a lot about databases, industry 4.0, machine and time-series data. I especially enjoy talking about case-studies related to IoT that we do with our clients. I also speak on WebXR with A-Frame and building multiplayer games with that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Sure, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was very thrilled about it but got very nervous the day before I had to give the talk. I experienced a cocktail of feelings like impostor syndrome, adrenaline rush and anxiety. Once I started speaking, I realised that I was really enjoying it and all the fear melted away. The talk went well, I had a lot of questions and the feedback was good. I watched the recorded video later on and identified a lot of things that I had to fix like filler words and so on. It‚Äôs not easy to watch a video of your talk but trust me, it can be the best way to improve your speaking skills. I even have a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZTJOhz6INQ\">my first talk on YouTube</a>, it helps me realize how far I have come and how far I still have to go.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZTJOhz6INQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúGetting Started With Web Based Virtual Reality‚Äù by Tanay Pant (his first conference talk)</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Applied to? Hundreds! Spoken at? I think it is probably close to twenty-five.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that is the most important for me is putting my Slack, laptop and mobile on do not disturb. I always take off my watch before going on the stage - loose watches can create a distraction for both the speakers and the audience by going up and down the wrist. Smartwatches on the other hand can light up with hand movements. I use an app called HiddenMe for hiding all the icons, files and folders from my Desktop, especially if I have to give a demo and need to exit Powerpoint. I think that it‚Äôs important to have a bottle of water on the stage especially for longer talks.</p>\n<p>I recently talked about pre-talk rituals with Niels Leenheer and you can hear stories from us about the things we do and why we do them <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue\">in the episode coming out on December 1</a>.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Well, there‚Äôs SO many things. Let‚Äôs go through a speaker‚Äôs journey from picking a topic to chatting with the audience at the end of the talk.</p>\n<p>First of all, topic selection. It‚Äôs most important to choose something really interesting to you, something that you are passionate about. That plays a huge factor in how much confidence and enthusiasm you have when you are up on the stage. If you‚Äôd like to know more about CFPs and how conferences select talks, I can highly recommend following <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/technicallytrue/talk-selection-in-conferences-with-kristina-schneider\">Kristina Schneider‚Äôs advice</a> on the topic (she organises CSSConfEU).</p>\n<p>Once your talk is ready, make sure to practice it well but also beware of over-rehearsing. Practising your talk a couple of times helps you to further tailor your talks and make them leaner. It also helps you with your confidence on stage in case something goes sideways.</p>\n<p>If something doesn‚Äôt go exactly as you wanted to on the stage or if the demo fails, make a joke about it and move on. Make sure that you have a video that you can show in its place. Don‚Äôt let it affect the rest of your talk and your morale. Things go wrong, it‚Äôs okay. This happens to everybody.</p>\n<p>Make sure you stick around after you talk to answer the questions from the audience and help them in any way you can. <strong>Never forget that the audience is the most important group in that room and always be humble.</strong> I can go on about this topic for hours, if you have more questions DO reach out to me.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>One of the talks that have inspired me the most was given by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mio_Loclair\">Christian Mio Loclair</a> in Berlin about <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/273373088\">Narciss</a> back in 2018. Having said that, there are a countless number of people who have inspired me and I usually end up inviting them to my podcast. üòÖ</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am most active on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tanay1337\">Twitter</a> but I can also be found on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337\">LinkedIn</a>.

While many tech conference speakers do it for their own personal development, some are specifically hired to speak, travel, and be a face for the community. That‚Äôs what Nicolas does now, but like all speakers, it‚Äôs taken a journey to get there. In today‚Äôs Speaker Story, we hear how Nicolas got started as well as some of his tips for new conference speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm Nicolas Fr√§nkel, a Developer Advocate at <a href=\"https://hazelcast.org/\">Hazelcast</a>. My main job is to speak at conferences, so that people know about Hazelcast the In-Memory-Data-Grid and <a href=\"https://jet.hazelcast.org/\">Jet</a>. I‚Äôm also the point of contact for the community.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been a teacher for more than 20 years, given that the best way to learn is to teach. However, some subjects are not relevant in academia. I discovered the <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/\">Vaadin web framework</a>, and I was so enthralled by it that I wanted to show it to the members of my local Java User Group. That was 7 years ago.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EOLCiAD.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects! For example, last summer, I was feeling a bit down with so much travelling around. I arrived at my hotel just a couple of hours before a talk. I wasn‚Äôt happy to be there, but I went to give the talk. After that, I felt really better, all bad feelings had been washed away.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I started public speaking at my Java user group one evening. Soon afterwards, when I travelled for work, I started to propose local user groups to host my talk. Then, I took vacations to speak at international conferences. I did more and more of them. <strong>But at one point, I realized that was pretty dumb to be paid to do a dull job (consulting on development/architecture) while taking vacations to do something that I really liked.</strong> One year ago, I steered my career toward Developer Advocacy, which includes a large part of public speaking.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a tech guy, so in general I stick to technical subjects. They include Java - it has been my bread and butter for years, Kotlin, Spring and Spring Boot, DevOps, Kubernetes and of course, Hazelcast IMDG and Jet.</p>\n<p>I once did a motivational talk, but it was quite hard for me. I might do more organizational/management-related talks in the future, as I already wrote some related blog posts already. But it means going far out of my comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first talk at my local user group very vividly.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, I was used to teach, but to talk in front of your peers is very different. <strong>When teaching, you speak from a position of power; when speaking in front of your peers, they will judge you - in a good or a bad way, and it will have a lasting effect.</strong> For this reason, I had asked some good friends to come, and they did. The room was overflowing with people, with some sitting on the stairs. I was very nervous before the talk, and in the first few minutes. Then, just like when coding, I focused on the subject at hand and went ‚Äúinto the zone‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember the specifics afterwards, it was just ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I believe the talk went pretty well, as I remember people clapping, and thus it was a great experience that helped me apply to speak again.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt keep the count of the number of conferences I‚Äôve submitted to, but to give you a rough idea, this year, I‚Äôll speak at a total of 68 conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt have routine per se, but I like to be at my place and prepared far in advance (at least 20 minutes). Being early was useful for a conference at the earlier this year, when I noticed very early that the projector didn‚Äôt work, and I had to run to find someone to help me.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Wow, answering this question could easily fill a book!</p>\n<p>Regarding impostor syndrome, the main advice would be the following: I often hear great and skilled people not submitting talks because they‚Äôre afraid they have nothing new to say. Well, if that would be the case, not many people would do public speaking. I believe on the opposite that <strong>most people have a unique experience and bring a unique viewpoint, even to subjects that have been spoken about a lot.</strong></p>\n<p>For finding conferences, I use <a href=\"https://www.papercall.io/\">papercall.io</a> and <a href=\"https://sessionize.com/\">sessionize.com</a>. They also allow to write your bio and abstract once, find your conferences, and then submit them at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>For the rest, I already wrote a post named <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Advices for junior conference speakers</a> that might be of interest. Expect more to come in the future.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I became exposed to the world of Developer Advocacy through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbaruch\">Baruch Sadogursky</a>. He was the one that made me understand by his behavior that public speaking could be a job - or at least a part thereof.</p>\n<p>For the sheer number of talks, I need to mention <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbuxman\">Josh Long</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/venkat_s\">Venkat Subramaniam</a>. As the latter told when he introduced himself during a panel is: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Venkat, I live in a plane‚Äù. And then he passed the mic.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have a <a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/\">blog where I publish a weekly post</a>.

Itai is in a great spot to speak on these topics too - his employer <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/\">Nielsen</a> has some truly large-scale data needs, which I imagine make for some interesting engineering problems.</p>\n<p>That said, the parts about speaking he enjoys most are the conversations and opportunities to learn from others. Read on to hear more about how Itai got into speaking and some of his tips for people considering giving their first talk.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tChR2X7.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Other than being married to Liron and a father to Yaara and Yuval, I‚Äôm also working at Nielsen, the data and measurement company. I work for a division called Nielsen Marketing Cloud, as the tech lead of the big data group (sometimes people confuse ‚Äútech lead‚Äù with ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù, so I wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/tech-lead-dont-you-mean-team-lead-c8bde92e38ab\">short post</a> to explain what I see as a tech lead üòÉ).</p>\n<p>In addition to that, I‚Äôm also a co-founder and a core team member of the Israeli chapter of <a href=\"https://www.womeninbigdata.org/\">Women in Big Data</a>.</p>\n<p>I actually got into public speaking more than 10 years ago, when I was invited to give a talk about Mainframes to a group of young soldiers during their basic programming course in the army. I really enjoyed it, and since then I‚Äôve had the chance to talk about various topics in several different forums, ranging from internal sessions, through local meetups, all the way to international conferences.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>While speaking at conferences is not part of my job per se, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs beneficial for my career in the long run, but that‚Äôs definitely not the main reason for me to do it. The main reason is actually the fact that it gives me an opportunity to meet a lot of smart people and share my knowledge with them - I absolutely love it!</p>\n<p>There are two added bonuses for speaking at conferences:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I get to attend other talks and learn from others as well.</li>\n<li>After I give a talk, people come up to me and ask questions, which always leads to very interesting conversations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bottom line - speaking at conferences is an awesome experience.</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>In the last 7 years or so, I‚Äôve been a big data developer and tech lead, so naturally I cover big data related topics, usually frameworks and tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Apache Druid.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve worked on data-centric systems since the early days of my career, and it‚Äôs funny how sometimes the terminology is similar, while the underlying technology has significantly evolved (e.g Mainframe batch jobs vs a Spark batch jobs). As a data engineer, it‚Äôs exciting to be able to use cutting-edge tools to process the ever-increasing amounts of data, and so is the opportunity to share with others how we actually use those tools.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>Yes, I definitely remember that talk! It was a local conference about 2.5 years ago, where my colleague, Yakir Buskilla (who‚Äôs now our VP R&#x26;D), and I spoke about how we use Druid for interactive count-distinct queries at scale.</p>\n<p>It was the first time I gave a talk to such a large audience (about 400 people), and I was excited (and a bit nervous of course‚Ä¶). We got great feedback after the talk, so I guess you can say it went well.</p>\n<p>You can check out the video recording of that talk below (my part starts at 12:01 minutes):</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOIJEBIVFDY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>‚ÄúUsing Druid for Interactive Count Distinct Queries at Scale‚Äù with Yakir Buskilla and Itai Yaffe</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since I joined Nielsen, over 5 years ago, I applied to around 10 conferences, and was accepted to about 7 of them. 2019 has been extremely successful for me as a speaker, presenting and co-presenting at 5 different conferences throughout the year. I also speak at meetups and other forums quite often.</p>\n<p>And, I‚Äôve already started working on my applications for next year‚Äôs conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I arrive a few minutes earlier to the location I‚Äôm going to talk at, and make sure everything is set-up properly. I also keep a bottle of water close by (just in case). Last but not least, it‚Äôs always helpful to pick a positive thought or idea that can lift your spirit and energize you right before getting on stage. I sometimes use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM\">Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù</a> (apparently, this is even <a href=\"https://loudwire.com/queen-dont-stop-me-now-worlds-most-uplifting-song/\">backed by a scientific study</a>).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I can give, is to[read my blog post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/how-to-present-at-meetups-and-survive-and-what-does-freddie-mercury-have-to-do-with-it-614b22a7fa9b\">How to present at meetups and survive (and what does Freddie Mercury have to do with it?)</a> üòÉ</p>\n<p>But to summarize the tips from that post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Success doesn‚Äôt (usually) happen overnight, it takes a lot of work.</li>\n<li>Try to make your talk a story worth telling - people always want to hear real-life stories about how others have dealt with common challenges.</li>\n<li>Practice makes perfect - conduct a lot of dry-runs and get early feedback.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let criticism get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt let yourself get you down.</li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt forget to enjoy!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been to several conferences and seen many great speakers, but I really look up to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holdenkarau\">Holden Karau</a> - her talks are always awesome, funny and insightful!</p>\n<p>She‚Äôs involved in quite a few open-source projects, and it‚Äôs really impressive she‚Äôs able to contribute to the open-source community both in terms of coding and in terms of sharing her knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôd love to meet you at <a href=\"https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe\">Spark+AI Summit Europe</a> on October 15-17 in Amsterdam, where I‚Äôll be talking about <a href=\"https://databricks.com/session_eu19/stream-stream-stream-different-streaming-methods-with-apache-spark-and-kafka\">different streaming methods with Spark and Kafka</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CXHhfJH.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm an Engineering Coach at Help Scout, and my daily job is to make sure that the engineers on my team are successful and that we‚Äôre shipping features that our customers love.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking at a young age. I did one-act plays in high school, and I also competed in <a href=\"https://www.uiltexas.org/speech/oral-interp/2019-20-uil-poetry-categories\">UIL poetry interpretation</a>. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity‚Äôs ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences!</p>\n<p>I give my talks because <strong>I believe that I have something to say that will help the attendees be better at the work they do</strong>. So, speaking is a way that I can help people, and helpfulness is one of my core values. There‚Äôs nothing better than the feeling I get when people come up to me after my talk (or sometimes weeks/months later) and tell me how it changed the way they thought about the topic. It‚Äôs even better when they share how it changed their behavior!</p>\n<p>Speaking isn‚Äôt part of my job, but it has greatly benefited my career. During job interviews, <strong>I‚Äôve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!</strong> While giving great talks alone wouldn‚Äôt have gotten me the offer, being qualified and a good speaker has been an incredible combination!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>My two primary topics are technology leadership and diversity and inclusion. My technology leadership talks draw on core principles as well as historical examples.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/leadership-lessons-from-the-agile-manifesto/\">Leadership Lessons from the Agile Manifesto</a> talk takes the values of the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and distills lessons for engineering managers and technical leads. I give easy to understand guidelines for making the tough decisions that leaders have to make when guiding engineering teams.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/technical-leadership-through-the-underground-railroad/\">Technical Leadership Through the Underground Railroad</a> talk uses the story of the daring John P. Parker who was a Conductor on the legendary Underground Railroad. I use his experience helping a group of enslaved people in 19th Century America escape from the Slave States to freedom.</p>\n<p>I give a talk with my wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons, called <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/managing-the-burnout-burndown/\">Managing the Burnout Burndown</a>, and we use the burndown chart used my many Agile teams as a metaphor for burning down stress. We describe how protecting your health, forming strong relationships, and removing distractions can help you avoid burn out.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/lending-privilege/\">Lending Privilege</a> talk describes how everyone has privilege and can use it to create a more diverse and inclusive technology industry. We can all help those who lack our privileges be more visible, have their voices heard, and get a chance to contribute their expertise to the software development process at our companies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at Podcamp Houston back in 2009. I think it went very well!</p>\n<p>My talk was called ‚ÄúRestoring Tech Cred to Houston‚Äù, and I made the case for Houston being an often overlooked tech hub when compared to other areas of the country like Silicon Valley, New York City, and Austin. One thing that‚Äôs important to know about this first talk was that I had the fortune of getting a lot of speaking experience as a normal part of my job. As an engineering manager, I did a lot of speaking as a person tasked with leading development teams. Of course, this work was done inside company walls and was not visible to the public. However, I found that when I did start public speaking I already had a great set of skills just from what I did at work.</p>\n<p><strong>So, if you‚Äôre a new speaker, you probably are more experienced than you realize if your job requires you to do a lot of communication (even if it‚Äôs just in small team meetings or Slack conversations).</strong></p>\n<p>My first large conference talk was at South by Southwest in 2010, and I went on to speak there several times. I started to really get serious about speaking at conferences when I did a Lightning Talk at OSCON in 2016. That‚Äôs when my public speaking work really began to take off!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I would guess over 500. I‚Äôve spoken at about 50 conferences so that tells you how tough the ratio of applications to acceptances can be.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a numbers game, and <strong>you shouldn‚Äôt let the rejection emails get you down</strong>. I‚Äôve spoken at conferences on three different continents, and I still regularly get rejected. Keep applying and refining your proposals. You‚Äôll start getting acceptances which usually lead to a higher acceptance rate.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine is meant to minimize variables and distractions as much as possible. I avoid drinking or eating anything two hours before my talk. That reduces the chance that I‚Äôll have an upset stomach or have to deal with digestion issues. I may drink coffee, but no later than 30 minutes before I go on stage (to avoid being too jittery).</p>\n<p>I make sure I‚Äôve been mic‚Äôd and have done a sound check and laptop check at least 30 minutes before my talk. I want to make sure that the mic is working, my slides are properly displayed on the screens, and my clicker (I use a <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote\">Logitech Spotlight</a>) and laptop are both fully charged.</p>\n<p>I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified. üòÉ</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you have something to say</strong>. Even an entry level talk can provide a ton of value. There is always someone who is new to the topic and needs help understanding the core concepts. Also, <strong>even people who are experts need reminders best practices and first principles</strong>. So, don‚Äôt count yourself out just because you think you‚Äôre not an expert.</p>\n<p>Second, pick one or two topics that you‚Äôre passionate about and use those for your talk proposals. You know you‚Äôre passionate about a topic if you‚Äôre already spending a lot of time reading about it, thinking about it, and debating it with people on Twitter. Wrap your talks around your passions. That way, you won‚Äôt get tired of your talks (it can happen over time), and the audience will sense your excitement. If you‚Äôre not excited about what you‚Äôre talking about, then how can the people in the seats get excited about you?</p>\n<p>Third, rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. I‚Äôve given a lot of talks, and I still get nervous. However, the best remedy I‚Äôve found for anxiety about stepping on stage is rehearse. You don‚Äôt have to memorize everything you‚Äôre going to say, but you need to have a solid idea of the journey you‚Äôre taking the audience on in your talk.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I look up to and have been inspired by so many speakers.

After speaking at local several meetups, Adri√°n started applying to conferences and has now been a speaker at 4 international gatherings. One of my favorite parts about speaking is the same as Adri√°n‚Äôs: meeting people from around the world.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sZRtBDT.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>My name is Adri√°n Bolonio. I‚Äôm an experienced Spanish Frontend developer and Web Team Lead, focusing now in Web Accessibility (a11y). Since 2012 I‚Äôve been living and working in Vienna. I currently work at <a href=\"www.willhaben.at\">willhaben</a>, the biggest classified company in Austria with the 2nd highest traffic of all Austrian websites.</p>\n<p>I started speaking at local meetups in Vienna, such as ViennaJS, ReactJS and then I talked at the DevFest Vienna, organised by the local Google Developer Group. I had the opportunity to organise an internal frontend conference inside my company for 100 people and I gave a talk as well there. I‚Äôm now sending more CFPs to International conferences to continue my speaking path.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like the feeling to contribution to the community. Sharing the knowledge I‚Äôve acquired over the years as a developer helps me improve my public speaking skills as well. Another thing that I love from conferences is networking and meeting new and amazingly interesting people from all over the world who share your interest and sometimes even hobbies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first talk. It was in the Vienna JS meetup, and I talked about a new library my team and I built at my current company. The idea was to share the library and promote it as open-source so anyone could use it. I was extremely nervous before going onto the stage, but the fact that my audience were developers too allowed me to relax a bit. At the end it went very well and smoothly. I got some very interesting questions after the talk and the people liked it.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJXzyHHh4pc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adri√°n Bolonio at ViennaJS</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to around 15 international conferences so far.

Now I‚Äôm a bit more experienced, so I check that my computer has enough battery or I have a charger that works. I check that all my other applications are closed and my notifications are muted. I check that the microphone works properly and the screen where the presentation is shown is readable from any point in the venue.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think the best and more difficult advice is ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs ok to be a bit nervous, but try to understand that if you have been chosen to give a talk at a conference or at a local meetup it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre an expert in that field, so you know what you‚Äôre talking about. Just calm down, enjoy the talk, and accept any feedback.</p>\n<p>It needs to be fun for you, you don‚Äôt have to suffer, so please enjoy the process.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Since I‚Äôm very focused now on Web Accessibility I follow a lot of experts, but some of them are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo\">Manuel Matuzovic</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_sergeikriger\">Sergei Kriger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next speaker appearance in a conference will be at the <a href=\"https://jsconf.co/\">JSConf Colombia</a> on October 18th &#x26; 19th, 2019.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9yzgNfr.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I work as Software Engineer at Growth Manager at <a href=\"https://echobind.com/\">Echobind</a>, a remote web and mobile consultancy for healthcare, life science, and technology companies (we‚Äôre hiring!) . On the side, I am also working on growing DevLifts, a company I started to help developers get fit.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking through starting to speak at local meetups a few years ago, and then subsequently running 3 meetups and having a hard time finding speakers sometimes.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences because I get to share my ideas with a lot of people in a conversational (and more human) manner (as opposed to Twitter) and have those ideas put to the test. I also love getting to meet lots of new developers! Attending conferences is obviously a way to do that, but speaking can make it easier since people will want to come talk to you after your talk.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I actually just gave my first conference talk earlier this month! Going into it, I was a little nervous just because I was covering a fairly sensitive topic (fitness &#x26; health), but it went great. I got to meet a bunch of developers and hear about what they do to stay fit and healthy.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Until recently, I had applied to maybe 5-6 conferences and been rejected by all by 1. But in the past 2 months I got more aggressive with it and have applied to 30ish conferences. I‚Äôve been accepted by 3 so far.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>About 15 minutes before, I‚Äôll make sure to find the MC (or whoever is in charge of getting me to the right place for my talk) and checking in with them so they know where I am. I‚Äôll have a glass of water and go to the bathroom. Then I‚Äôll grab another glass of water to sip throughout the talk if necessary. I‚Äôll also turn my phone off and put it in my backpack or somewhere not on my person. Most importantly, I always make sure my notifications are muted!!!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> gave me some fantastic advice before my first conference talk. I was a bit nervous and he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not nervous. You‚Äôre excited.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Nervousness is inward focused ‚Äî I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll screw up, I‚Äôm afraid something will go wrong, I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll hate my talk, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll start Twitter war.</p>\n<p>Being excited is outward focused ‚Äî I‚Äôm excited to give this talk to help others with this area of their lives. I‚Äôm doing this because I want to help other developers. If at least one person walks away feeling good/empowered/excited/etc., I‚Äôll be happy.</p>\n<p>As a conference organizer, I‚Äôll also say to new speakers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Show up early (at least an hour before your talk). This makes the organizers much less stressed if they know you are in the building because they‚Äôve seen you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure the MC can find you 15-20 minutes before your talk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice your talk. If you didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs obvious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be flexible. Organizing conferences is hard and usually being done for free as a labor of love. Being a diva because you can‚Äôt get a certain type of water will definitely get you on the <em>do-not-invite-back</em> list.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>So many, but here are a few:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> is hands down the best speaker I know. I love being part of his audience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler\">Ken Wheeler</a> has the best combination of jokes and crazy good demos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dabit3\">Nader Dabit</a> got me into speaking because he‚Äôs one of the first people I saw give a tech talk at our local meetup years ago.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a> because daaaaaang does that dude know how to keep a crowd engaged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\">Brian Holt</a> because his talks have always been funny, mind-blowing, and approachable to me.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next scheduled conference talk is at <a href=\"https://connect.tech/\">Connect.tech</a> this October!

I also write tutorials on topics such as Git &#x26; Gatsby.</p>\n<p>My mission is to make the learning curve of software development an easier process for everyone. I got into speaking after I was invited to share my story of how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaelurAlexis/status/1046663234978115585\">I transitioned into tech from fast food</a> at CascadiaJS in November 2018. A few months later, I decided to just follow accounts like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfp_land\">@cfpland</a> and submit talks!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like how I‚Äôm putting myself out there and slowly yet surely coming out of my introverted shell. I‚Äôve always had a secret obsession with researching and curating resources so being able to travel and present my findings is my thing. The public speaking is a strategic move, my goal is to get into developer advocacy.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7idBFx7erWA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tae‚Äôlur Alexis, ‚ÄúCreating 3D User Experiences with React‚Äù at React 360</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first solo conference talk was just recently actually! It occurred June 6, 2019. It was RefactrTech, a conference based in Atlanta and the presentation was titled, ‚ÄúBuilding Accessible UI with React‚Äù. The talk consisted of me discussing ways you can improve the accessibility of your application and the different libraries and tools you can use.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to at least 15, have been accepted to 8 and have spoken at one so far.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My process has so far been to gather so many resources on the topic I‚Äôm presenting on and read through the documentation and possibly experiment with building demos. Building demos can really help you with learning the ins and outs on a topic and you never know what you may uncover.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Advice I‚Äôd give to new speakers before they give a talk is to remember these are regular people who are rooting for you. And the biggest step is to just be there. And when it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over. Afterwards you‚Äôre free to roam, explore and breathe.</p>\n<p>You don‚Äôt need to be an expert, just be passionately curious. Follow @cfp_land, have an interesting talk title and abstract (summary of what your talk would be on) and just submit to every conference that‚Äôs relevant to your interests. You can submit multiple talks and I highly encourage you do so. People call this ‚Äúconference-driven development‚Äù. The submissions are reviewed and approved MONTHS before the conference actually happens so you‚Äôll have time.</p>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that‚Äôs worked for me is to literally search ‚Äútech cfp‚Äù on Twitter!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

Eve Porcello invited me to her GraphQL workshop at CascadiaJS in Seattle and seeing how comfortable she was presenting on such an advanced topic was so inspiring. And then to know she‚Äôs authored O‚ÄôReilly books and travels doing conference talks and workshops for a living BLEW. MY. MIND.</p>\n<p>Then I meet Marcy Sutton who embraced me after I spoke on stage about my story. Her passion around accessibility and learning more about her role in developer advocacy is literally why I do what I do today. They are both the reason why I‚Äôve pursued accessibility and developer advocacy. I want to be able to use my interest in writing and community engagement to make an impact and have a nomadic career.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/TaelurAlexis\">follow me on Twitter</a> and I post weekend recaps on what I have going on in my life <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TaelurAlexis\">on YouTube here</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm building an online platform called <a href=\"https://codeeveryday.io/\">CodeEveryday</a> where I‚Äôm providing learning resources, mentorship and job postings so you can subscribe to the newsletter as we prep for the release!

It‚Äôs easy when you\nspend every day working with caching in Ruby, for example, to forget that most devs never get the chance to do what you do.\nLike Molly, many speakers realize that their unique knowledge is worth sharing, and start getting on stage. In this interview,\nwe talked about Molly‚Äôs journey and some of her advice for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sU57xj3.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am currently the Lead Site Reliability Engineer at Kenna Security. I have been working at Kenna for almost 4 years now and I got into public speaking last year thanks to the support at Kenna.</p>\n<p>My lead at the time suggested that I find ways I could share my knowledge with others. I had become extremely proficient and knowledge about making performance improvements in our Ruby application so I started with sharing that knowledge internally and then decided to try submitting a talk on it to a conference. I submitted a proposal to RubyConf not thinking anything would come of it. Because my expectations were low I also submitted a talk to a local meetup about another technical passion of mine, Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, BOTH talks were accepted and my Fall quickly became very busy. I had done debate and was good at speaking in high school, but I was not sure what to expect from technical speaking. After giving my first talk and seeing the response it got and how thankful the people were, I was hooked! It has been less than a year since that first talk and I have given 2 conference talks since, plus a few Meetup talks.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I enjoy being able to share my advice with a lot of people at once. It is like mentoring or giving advice on steroids. I also really enjoy getting out of the office and getting to meet other devs. Everyone has such difference experiences and being able to chat with everyone is a great way to bring back new ideas and learn new things.</p>\n<p>It has definitely benefited my career because I have made so many amazing professional connections via speaking. All of my talks were inspired by my work, but are not required for me to do my job. The speaking and additional connections I have made have also benefited Kenna as well in the form of bringing in job candidates. Kenna has been very supportive of all the speaking and covers all of my expenses whenever I speak.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>You bet I do since it was last November! It went fabulous! For a few days after I was on a high from it.</p>\n<p>I have looked up to many speakers and the idea of me being up on the stage was almost something I couldn‚Äôt comprehend. Once I did it, I was amazed with myself and also immediately ready to do it again! My only regret was that I left my necklace on and that interfered with the mic near the end. I was worried that it might have been horrible for those listening, but no one said anything. I don‚Äôt think many people even noticed. Being a perfectionist, I definitely did. But live and learn!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEi-vYcyTT8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2018-cache-is-king-get-the-most-bang-for-your-buck-from-ruby\">Cache is King: Get the Most Bang for Your Buck From Ruby by Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I have spoken at 3 conferences and applied to probably 9, some of which are this fall so I am waiting to hear back about those. The 3 conferences I have spoken at have all been Ruby conferences which have been incredible! A couple I applied to in the Fall are Site Reliability and DevOps conferences. I am interested, if accepted, to see how they differ.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I am a big proponent of practicing my talk!</p>\n<p>I know some people who prefer not to practice and they do better when they wing it, but I am not one of those people. I like to know exactly what I am going to say when I get up there. Because of that I practice my talk a lot and I memorize my intro and ending so those are guaranteed to go smoothly. Right before I talk I like to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en\">Power Pose</a>. But when I Power Pose, I do it with a twist. I recite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zFHkBQBg-4\">these lines from Jr in Cool Runnings</a> All of that helps me feel really confident and bad ass before I go on.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I have for new speakers, especially those who feel intimidated by speaking at a conference, is to start small. <strong>Begin by giving talks internally at your company first.</strong> It could be as simple as giving a demo of a feature you built. From there, consider lightening talks at a conference or even a talk at a Meetup. Once you are comfortable, then apply to a conference.</p>\n<p>If you are a new speaker that has already been accepted to give a conference talk then my best advice would be to <strong>give your talk in a smaller setting about a month before</strong>. This forces you to get the talk done early which will save you from last minute, frantic cramming. It will also allow you to get some feedback on the talk. I gave my first conference talk 3 times before RubyConf. I gave it at 2 small meetups and once for my coworkers. Every time I got great feedback that I was able to use to tweak the talk and make it more clear and approachable.</p>\n<p>Picking a topic can also be a struggle for people who want to get started, but sometimes feel they have nothing ‚Äúnew‚Äù to talk about. First and foremost, <strong>ANY topic is fair game even if people have talked about it before</strong>. You can always bring a new perspective to a topic. Even presenting new examples for a topic could help someone who has heard the topic a thousand times finally understand it. My first conference talk I wrote, Cache is King, I thought for sure it was too ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and not ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù enough to ever be considered. But I quickly learned, most conference talks aren‚Äôt about discovering something new, they are about taking a topic and presenting it in a way that is approachable and helps your audience learn something.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek\">Saron Yitbarek</a> has been HUGELY inspirational as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/r00k\">Ben Ornstein</a>.</p>\n<p>Right after I got accepted to speak at my first conference I watched Saron‚Äôs talk on building a community which gave me all the good feels I needed to believe I could take on this daunting task. I then watched Ben Ornstein‚Äôs talk on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JXH7JPjR4\">How to Give a Technical Talk</a> and that really inspired me to make my speech relatable and entertaining. My favorite quote is, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt teach them anything if you don‚Äôt have their attention‚Äù</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have been pretty good about keeping my personal website up to date and that is <a href=\"https://www.mollystruve.com/\">www.mollystruve.com</a>. There I have links to my Twitter, blog, Instagram, Facebook, etc. I am also very passionate about blogging so I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt include a link directly to my blog, <a href=\"https://dev.to/molly_struve\">dev.to/mollystruve</a>.</p>\n<p>I am a big fan of taking a talk and breaking it down into blog posts so it can reach more people. The opposite works as well, I have used some of my blogs to drive some talk ideas.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Molly Struve, Site Reliability Engineer and Technical Speaker","path":"/blog/speaker-molly-struve/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/08/02","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NV6zKJ8y_TNM5EM6ihCTtfrmw9s9JVHY"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a Lead Designer at 8th Light, a custom software consultancy. I do UX and front-end development and work with various clients on designing and building their software.</p>\n<p>I was never interested in public speaking, but before I became a designer about 3 years ago I worked at an education-focused non-profit, and have a background in teaching, so I‚Äôve always been pretty comfortable in the very small scale stage of a classroom. Before I started at 8th Light I volunteered doing a workshop about domestic violence, and part of my apprenticeship involved doing a talk for a small group of people, and I did that workshop.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of positive feedback, and eventually did a version of it at our internal company conference. A while later, a co-worker who was organizing a Ruby conference asked me to do a short talk about how developers could do quick usability testing, so that they could have good UX of features they were building when there wasn‚Äôt a designer in the room. That talk went pretty well despite the fact that I felt like I was going to pass out the entire time.</p>\n<p>I did that talk at another conference, but quickly felt a strong urge to go back to speaking about something I really cared about. I had been thinking for a long time about the ways that technology enables domestic violence, and had been collecting examples, but never felt like I was an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù enough to do a talk about it. It really seemed like something that other, smarter people were working on. But eventually I realized that wasn‚Äôt true, that if someone out there was already talking about this stuff, I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me find them.</p>\n<p>Right around that time, Russ Unger, who leads UX Camp in Chicago, responded to a proposal I‚Äôd submitted saying my topic wasn‚Äôt quite right, and he asked ‚Äúis there anything else you‚Äôve though about doing a talk about?‚Äù I told him about my idea for a talk about how tech enables domestic violence, and he said that would be perfect for the conference. I owe him a lot for taking the time to figure out that this talk was on my mind and giving me what I needed to finally do it. It took dozens of hours of research and stitching together stories from news articles and people who had disclosed their experiences to me to make my talk, but I finally did it, and ever since UX Camp I‚Äôve had a lot of success with it.</p>\n<h3>What do you focus on speaking about?</h3>\n<p>My speaking is all about how technology enables domestic violence; how abusers can utilize technology to further their power and control over their victims, and how products that don‚Äôt enable abuse but are clearly spaces where survivors are taking certain actions that disclose the abuse and meaningful intervention could be provided (‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù is the preferred term instead over ‚Äúvictim‚Äù, since it speaks to the person‚Äôs ability to endure and survive a dangerous situation.)</p>\n<p>I tell a story about someone experiencing domestic violence in 5 different areas, give stats that correlate to those areas, and describe ways that more thoughtful design or building of the product could prevent the abuse. The 5 areas are financial abuse through online banking tools, harassment and monitoring through ‚Äúsmart‚Äù home devices/Internet of Things devices, stalking through GPS-enabled devices, personal security through software such as building management software, and how fitness, wellness, and pregnancy products could be a place of meaningful intervention.</p>\n<p>I think it goes without saying that domestic violence is a worthwhile thing to do a talk about, but just in case you need convincing, here are some stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 in 3 American women will experience severe physical abuse at the hands of an intimate partner.</li>\n<li>For men, that number is 1 in 4. Domestic violence is not an edge case.</li>\n<li>The number one cause of death among pregnant women in America is murder by her current or ex intimate partner.</li>\n<li>3 women are murdered by their current or ex intimate partners in America each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt see myself as a ‚Äúpublic speaker‚Äù - I really just want to spread the content of my talk because I think it‚Äôs really important.</p>\n<p>But I‚Äôve learned a few things: <strong>first, as someone who gets a lot of stage fright, the only thing that helps is just doing it a bunch.</strong> After 4 or 5 times talking a stage, it started to get a lot easier. After doing it a bunch and not dying, you start to realize it‚Äôs going to be ok. That‚Äôs the advice I give people who ask about speaking even though they‚Äôre not a natural public speaker - you have to just do it, but then it quickly gets a lot easier.</p>\n<p><strong>The second thing I like about speaking at conferences is that I also get to attend them!</strong> I think I‚Äôve grown in my career more rapidly than average in part because of attending half a dozen conferences in the past few months and learning a ton. My advice is to focus on applying to conferences you‚Äôd actually want to attend, so that they‚Äôre also a learning experience for you. I can only do so many conferences in a year, so I figure I might as well prioritize speaking at ones I also want to attend.</p>\n<p><strong>The third thing I like is that speaking at conferences unexpectedly helped with my social anxiety a lot.</strong> I‚Äôm introverted and socially anxious, but so many days of having strangers come up and talk to me about my talk, and share their experiences with violence, was the intense exposure I needed to start to get past my social anxiety. Within 6 months, I‚Äôve become so much more confident talking to strangers and being in new situations that would have induced a lot of anxiety in the past - all thanks to conference speaking. I really want people to know that you can be introverted, awkward, and socially anxious, and still be a great conference speaker and get a ton of benefit from doing it.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>7 so far, with a few more confirmed for the fall - include StrangeLoop, which I almost didn‚Äôt apply to because it seemed like such a long shot! I‚Äôve applied to about 40, and gotten 10 rejections, with the other 23 still up in the air.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhWPnKg4oK4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Eva PenzeyMoog: Designing Against Domestic Violence</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Deep breathing! And lots of practice, to the point that you don‚Äôt need to rely on speaker notes. It makes such a difference.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Two things:</p>\n<p><strong>You do NOT need to have the talk written before you write a proposal for that talk to apply to conferences with, and you do NOT need to already be an expert in the field that you‚Äôre proposing a talk about.</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling like you need to know and do so many things before even applying to something you might get rejected from is a surefire way to get overwhelmed and never start. Choose something you‚Äôre legitimately interested in and would want to become an expert in, write the proposal and apply to as many conferences as possible. Once you get accepted to one, then create the talk and learn all about it. You don‚Äôt need to present the answers in your proposal. I wish someone had spelled this out for me earlier on - I would have started applying with this talk a lot sooner!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie\">Sara Wachter-Boettcher</a> is a huge inspiration. She keeps it real - she‚Äôll call out the chatbot you‚Äôre using at your conference for defaulting to a woman‚Äôs name, and point out all the ways Facebook is terrible when a table full of Facebook designers is right in front of her. I really value that, and before her, had seen plenty of men behave that way, but no women. She‚Äôs not afraid to hold people accountable, but doesn‚Äôt make it personal. She strikes a perfect balance, and getting to see her speak and attend one of her workshops was incredibly valuable to see as I‚Äôm working on developing my own speaking style. I was lucky enough to randomly be seated with her at a shared table at a restaurant we were both at after I saw her talk at a conference, and got to ask her all my questions and get amazing advice. I think that was the moment I started to feel like the universe really wants me to do this work. Serendipitous things like that keep happening. And I‚Äôm trying to pay it forward - I‚Äôm all about getting more women and other underrepresented voices into the conference speaking circuit.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My website is <a href=\"https://evapenzeymoog.com/\">evapenzeymoog.com</a> and my Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/epenzeymoog\">@epenzeymoog</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Eva PenzeyMoog, Designer Helping Stamp Out Domestic Abuse","path":"/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/26","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PZhgAIc.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I started my career as a UX designer at a design agency. <strong>Being an introvert, I was very uncomfortable speaking in meetings and used to literally run away from having the spotlight on me.</strong> I even had a hard time speaking in front of my own team. Each time I stood up to talk I would get the classic symptoms such as dry mouth, profuse sweating, and forgetting what I wanted to say. It was frustrating because I noticed others who would get up and speak effortlessly and I wanted that for myself. I wanted to be able to get up and speak without hesitation and share my ideas.</p>\n<p>It was time to act.</p>\n<p>So I decided to turn things around and searched for ways to improve my public speaking skills. My search led me to a 30-day online speaking challenge which focused on specific areas in public speaking such as speed, filler words, pacing, etc. The last exercise of the challenge was to create a presentation of my own and record myself presenting it. At that time I was also diving into the world of sketching so I created a 5-minute talk about sketching journey. To test out my presentation I needed real people to present it to so I searched for meetups and found a developer meetup which was looking for presenters for their next meetup. Their CFP page was very inviting towards new speakers which gave me the confidence to apply. I jumped on the chance and submitted my talk proposal and that‚Äôs when my public speaking journey began.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>For me, it‚Äôs all about the people. Whether it‚Äôs someone who connects with my message or another speaker who is just starting out, I love meeting new people and making friends at conferences.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don‚Äôt know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of speaking at conferences is that each conference brings its own challenges such as room layouts, the acoustics of rooms, the size of the audience, the distance to the audience, lighting, etc. these all present challenges that help us grow.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first conference talk very clearly because it was started out a bit rough. I was really nervous before the event because I didn‚Äôt know anyone in the sea of people. The layout of the room I was presenting it was a bit challenging. There was a big column right in the middle of the room which divided the audience into two sides. The windows were from floor to ceiling which sounds nice but made it extremely difficult to see my slides. We had to turn off the lights to be able to see them so I presented my talk in the dark, talk about throwing you off your game. As I began my presentation I noticed the people in the audience with their expressionless stares which made me think I was boring them. This started the negative self-talk in my head while I was presenting which never turns out well and it caused me to read my slides instead of looking at the audience. Towards the end, I felt much better and more in control of my talk. After the event, I felt a bit disheartened but I was determined to learn from the events of the day and improve for the next time.</p>\n<p>Each new talk presents challenges and opportunities to learn from and to help us grow. I am still learning from my ‚Äúmis-takes‚Äù and addressing the areas I need to improve in. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that public speaking is a continuous learning process. Never stop learning.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/REn0gvq.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I haven‚Äôt kept count but I know I have applied to many conferences. My CFP rejected-to-win ratio is probably around 0.00001 which is definitely an exercise in learning how to accept rejection and not take it personally.</p>\n<p>I have presented at 6 conferences in the US and in Europe. My talk recently was accepted at a conference in Oslo which improves the ratio just a little bit.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>A week before my talk, my routine consists of getting a fresh haircut and picking out the outfit I will wear. I also make sure I have all the dongles, adapters, cables, remotes I need.</p>\n<p>On the day of the talk, I make sure I have a good breakfast and pack a few snacks just in case I get hungry before the talk.</p>\n<p>If I am speaking at a conference, I make sure to scope out the room I will be presenting in beforehand to check out the stage and seating arrangements. This way I can visualize myself up on the stage presenting beforehand, which help me feel prepared.</p>\n<p>Right before giving my talk I will do some breathing exercises, and if I really need to get pumped up then I will find stairs nearby and go up and down them quickly to warm up and get my blood flowing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>I recommend new speakers look for opportunities to present at work, meetups, schools, basically anywhere they can.</strong> At work, you can present at a Lunch and Learn session. Don‚Äôt have a Lunch and Learn session at work? Why not start one? This will give you the opportunity to present regularly and get more practice. Meetup organizers are always looking for new people to present and share their ideas. You can also start off with Lightning Talks which are short 5-minute presentations on any topic you want and are a great entry point to start your public speaking journey.</p>\n<p>Another tip I like to share is to make your talk interactive. <strong>Find ways to get your audience engaged with your message through exercises, questions, or discussions.</strong> Getting the audience involved will help them connect with your message on a deeper level and when the audience is engaged I notice that I relax more and become less anxious since.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Inspiration is everywhere. Whether it‚Äôs a team member presenting at work, a speaker at a conference, or kids presenting at an elementary school, I find inspiration by observing people and how they communicate. I have presented my talks at elementary schools and I‚Äôm especially inspired by the confidence kids have in standing up and sharing their ideas without hesitation which is something I am working towards.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>A good thing about having a somewhat unique name is that if you Google Rizwan Javaid, I will show up. Not personally, that would be creepy but the search results will be mostly about me. You can also follow my updates on my website, <a href=\"https://rizwanjavaid.com/\">rizwanjavaid.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rizwanjavaid/\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rizwanjavaid/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rizwanjavaid\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@rizwanjavaid\">Medium</a>.</p>\n<p>My next conference workshop is at <a href=\"https://2019.javazone.no/\">JavaZone</a> in Oslo in September.
