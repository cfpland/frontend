We catalog <a href=\"/blog/data\">about 400 per year at CFP Land</a>, but there are even more that we don’t find. If you’re new to the field, you might be surprised that there could be that many events, but as this post elaborates, no two tech conferences are alike. These conferences range in size, topic focus, cost, and competitiveness for speakers.</p>\n<h2>How Do Conferences Differ?</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at a few of the dimensions you might use to compare technology conferences:</p>\n<h3>1. Breadth and Depth</h3>\n<p>If you’re in a narrow specialty, you may not have the opportunity to meet with many similar professionals in your city often. Some conferences cater to these narrow “niches”, and go really deep into a single area of focus.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there are some tech conferences that cover a huge range of technologies and disciplines. These usually last longer and have multiple “tracks” so attendees can choose the talks they are most interested in.</p>\n<h3>2. Tracks</h3>\n<p>“Tracks” are the way most conferences divide up talks by specialty or area of interest. Some tech conferences may have a track for design, another for development, and a third for product managers. Usually these individual tracks are capped off with one or two keynotes which have broad appeal to most attendees.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Single-track conferences can be nice because you’re guaranteed the maximum audience size. However, it also means that there may be people in the audience who don’t care about your talk. With a multi-track conference, the people who do attend your talk will be more interested in what you have to say. But this also brings anxiety or disappointment when not as many people choose your talk as you’d like, and you have to give your talk to an awkwardly small crowd.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Attendees</h3>\n<p>Some niche, regional conferences may attract fewer than 100 attendees. I’ve been to a couple where you didn’t really even need a microphone to reach the whole audience. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are some tech conferences with thousands of attendees who swarm on massive convention centers for days at a time.</p>\n<p>The smaller ones can be nice if you really want to form close relationships with a few people, but sometimes it’s nice to slip into anonymity at a huge conference and not have to see the same 5 people all the time.</p>\n<h3>4. Frequency</h3>\n<p>The majority of tech conferences happen annually, but there are some with bi-annual cadences. Usually these will hold one event in America and the other in Europe to allow attendees on both hemispheres the opportunity to attend.</p>\n<h3>5. Location</h3>\n<p>Conferences don’t necessarily happen in big cities, but it is more common. If people are traveling to attend, it’s usually easier to host the event in a large, central location. That said, there are some conferences that happen in unique venues: a <a href=\"https://www.codercruise.com/\">cruise ship</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.atechconference.com/\">island</a>, or <a href=\"https://nomadphp.com/\">online</a>.</p>\n<h3>6. Corporate vs. Community Run</h3>\n<p>A few large tech companies run their own conferences with the goal of promoting their technology and building a community of users. For example, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite\">Microsoft’s Ignite</a> and <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/\">Amazon’s re:Invent</a>. Just because these conferences have a clear agenda doesn’t mean the content isn’t valuable though. Many of us rely on keeping up with the latest technology that these companies release.</p>\n<p>Community run conferences sit at the other end of the spectrum. These events are managed by fans or advocates for a particular language, technology, or project, and are often much lower-budget. Some rely on donations; some partner with sponsors; and others charge attendees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some conferences are for-profit. Others make little to no money for the organizers, and are largely a labor of love for the community. Some for-profit conferences will masquerade as the latter. Make sure you know what the conference is and if you’re comfortable with it before you accept.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Running a conference is notoriously challenging and expensive. Organizers have to coordinate a lot of details; pay for food, event space, speakers, and staff; find sponsors; sell tickets…the list goes on! If you’re interested in how this all shakes out, <a href=\"https://2019.jsconf.eu/news/the-jsconf-cssconf-eu-finances/\">JS Conf Europe’s organizers wrote an interesting overview of their finances last year</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why Attend?</h2>\n<p>Plenty of experienced technology professionals never go to or speak at a conference. They can be expensive, take away time from focused work, and awkward - especially if you don’t know anyone there. That said, there are some great reasons to try attending a tech conference sometime:</p>\n<h3>1. Learn New Skills</h3>\n<p>The tools available to technology professionals is changing rapidly, and it can be hard to keep up. Newsletters, blogs, and local usergroups are all a great place to turn, but so are conferences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conferences are prime place for learning about new or obscure libraries and packages that you haven’t used before. If it’s been done before, then someone somewhere will eventually give a talk about it.\n<em><a href=\"https://opensource.com/life/16/2/attending-technical-conferences-whats-big-deal\">Deb Nicholson</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>2. Meet New People</h3>\n<p>While attending talks is an obvious way to learn new things at a conference, you may also pick up some new ideas from your fellow attendees. Meeting people at conferences is also a great way to find a job or look for job candidates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like meeting like-minded people with the profession in common…I like the positive energy conferences have and regardless of where you work or the number of years of experience one has all of the participants are there to learn and share the experience.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-geshan-manandhar/\">Geshan Manandhar</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Be Inspired</h3>\n<p>Great speakers can motivate you; ignite your passions; inspire you to do something you woudn’t have. Not every tech conference has room for a ton of inspirational talks, but many conferences try to include some of these in their keynote slots.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYlT4lU5pb4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>“A Tinker Story” by dina Amin</em></p>\n<h3>4. Have Fun</h3>\n<p>Finally, attending a tech conference can be really fun. Last time I went to <a href=\"https://www.codemash.org/\">Codemash</a>, I got to visit the NASA facilities in Sandusky, Ohio, see the indoor water park, and play virtual reality video games in the arcade for hours after the talks ended.</p>\n<p>If you think attending a tech conference is a great experience, keep reading! Next we’ll learn why you might want to move from the audience to the stage and start speaking at tech conferences too.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../\">Previous: Index</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../why-speak/\">Next: Why Speak? The Reasons People Get on Stage</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"An Introduction to Technology Conferences","path":"/guides/speaking/introduction/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Once you’re very well established as a technology conference speaker, you might start getting invited to speak, but for most speakers, this takes a long time if it happens at all. The reality is that conferences typically get many more speakers interested than they have slots, so they almost always hold an open “Call for Proposals” or CFP.</p>\n<p><em>For more detail on how conferences select speakers, check out <a href=\"../how-conferences-choose/\">Section 3: How Conferences Choose Their Speakers</a></em></p>\n<p>Before you can submit any CFPs though, you’ll need to find them. In this section, we’ll look at various methods for finding conferences with open calls for proposals and selecting those that are worth your time.</p>\n<h2>Finding CFPs</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP).”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/\">Jaime Lopez</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are several ways that you can find out about CFPs:</p>\n<h3>1. Contact the Conference Directly</h3>\n<p>If you are focused on just a few specific conferences, you could reach out directly to each of them to express your interest in submitting. Many conferences start planning 6 months before the event, so they might be looking for CFPs early. That said, some organizers may not start working until 3 months before the event, or they might not have time to answer every email individually. In this case, you’ll end up spending a lot of time chasing them.</p>\n<p>In most cases, it’s unnecessary to ask a conference directly when their CFP will open as they’ll probably post something about it on their website. But, it’s worth mentioning because some conferences never hold an open CFP, so you have to reach out directly.</p>\n<h3>2. Subscribe to the Conference’s Website or Newsletter</h3>\n<p>Assuming the conference holds an open CFP, they’re likely to tell as many people as they can about it in their blog or newsletter. If you’re targeting a few specific conferences, this might be the best way to ensure you don’t miss their CFPs. Be careful counting on conference newsletters too much though. Some organizers are not very good at sending them, and they may forget to publicize their CFP that way.</p>\n<p>It will be annoying to check every conference website you’re interested in submitting to every few weeks, but it may be the only way to ensure you don’t miss a certain CFP.</p>\n<h3>3. Social Media</h3>\n<p>Twitter is probably the most popular social network for technology conferences and speakers, so you may want to start following people there. Following individual conferences will get you started, but there are a number of good accounts that tweet out about open CFPs. You can also save a few Twitter searches to accomplish this goal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">Tae’lur Alexis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Use a CFP Aggregator</h3>\n<p>I’m biased towards this one - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/how-cfpland-came-to-be/\">that’s why I started CFP Land</a> - but it’s also the most convenient method if you want to apply to speak at a lot of conferences. <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">Confs.tech</a>, and <a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">CallingAllPapers</a> are the most comprehensive CFP aggregators, but there are other niche topic aggregators as well. At CFP Land, we add the perks that speakers can expect from the conference, but you could also look that information up yourself on each conference’s website.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these aggregators have a list of open CFPs and some of them offer a newsletter or email alerts as well. The biggest downside to a CFP aggregator is that you’re bound to miss some conferences that they aren’t aware of. I’ve collected over 1200 conference CFPs in the past two years, but every month subscribers submit dozens of new ones that I didn’t know existed.</p>\n<h2>Deciding Which CFPs to Submit to</h2>\n<p>As you start learning more about the wide array of conferences out there, you’ll discover that there are likely more open CFPs than you have time to submit to. Every speaker must decide which conferences are worth their time, so while you may not be as picky when you’re just getting started, it’s certainly worth considering the following criteria with each CFP.</p>\n<h3>1. Topic Area</h3>\n<p>You don’t have to have a complete talk ready before you start submitting abstracts to open Calls for Proposals, but you should have some idea what kind of topics you want to speak about. While conferences will usually look for a range of talks, you are never going to get a Ruby talk accepted to a Python conference. Plus, as Nick points out, that Python conference may not be interesting to you anyway:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Maybe you can get your talk on web accessibility accepted at DjangoCon, but if you aren’t interested in Python, then the rest of the conference will be of minimal value to you.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most conferences will provide information about the topics and kinds of talks they want on the CFP page, but if they don’t take a look at videos or listings of the previous year’s talks. This should give you some idea what they are looking for.</p>\n<h3>2. Location</h3>\n<p>One of the first conferences I spoke at was Codemash, and while I loved the event, traveling to Sandusky, Ohio in January is not always pleasant. As you look for conferences, you may want to prioritize those in locations that would be fun to visit or where you have friends or coworkers.</p>\n<p>I’ve actually spoken at some conferences that did not pay for my hotel because I had a friend in town I could stay with anyway. This makes it easier for the conference to support you financially, plus I got to hang out with an old college friend who lives on the other side of the country.</p>\n<h3>3. Financial Viability</h3>\n<p>Getting accepted to speak at a conference in Thailand may sound great, but if they don’t cover your flight costs, you might be paying several thousand dollars just to get there. Most conferences will list the speaker perks they offer on their website, but if not, you can email the organizers directly to ask. In my experience, about 30% of tech conferences cover travel and hotel costs for their speakers, and about 1% offer an extra stipend.</p>\n<p>Another way to fund your speaking excursion might be to turn to your employer. Some companies offer an education budget to employees, and attending a conference - even as a speaker - is certainly an educational experience. You could also make the argument that you’ll help your employer raise awareness of their product or any open job listings while you’re there. It may or may not work, but it’s worth trying.</p>\n<p>Finally, many conferences offer other perks to speakers - whether they can cover travel or not. For example, I’ve seen conferences offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free speaker training sessions</li>\n<li>Airport transportation</li>\n<li>Speaker’s dinner</li>\n<li>Gift bags or cards for speakers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these add-ons may help make speaking more financially viable, but to be honest, most new speakers will not get paid much for their speaking directly.</p>\n<h3>4. Reputation</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not all conferences are born equal: whether you like it or not, there’s a “coolness” factor attached to each of them.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether you call it “coolness” or “reputation” or “prestige”, it’s true that not all conferences hold the same weight. Many smaller, regional conferences are more like a big meetup, so speaking there may not be that difficult. On the other hand, some huge tech events are extremely competitive and aim to only accept world-class speakers. Either way, there’s no harm in applying to speak at a conference that you feel is “above your pay grade.” The only way to move up is to go for it!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I recommend looking at videos from prior years and looking at the conference website, to see if it appears to be the work of conscientious, detail-oriented, experienced people.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you may start by applying at smaller, newer conferences, it is a good idea to look into how the conference has been run in the past. Do they treat their speakers and attendees well? Are the organizers well-known? Do they have a good reputation? Ask around if you don’t know anyone who’s been to the event personally.</p>\n<p>Finally, consider whether or not you want to take a risk by speaking at a first time conference. I have had good and bad experiences with new events: one had to cancel the event due to lack of interest, and the other was an awesome conference run by very professional and experienced people. Talk to the organizers and do what you can to understand their vision for the event.</p>\n<h3>5. Commitment to Diversity</h3>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, you should know whether the event has a commitment to diversity and will provide a welcoming environment for all attendees and speakers. You don’t want to be attached to an event that gets bad press for excluding people or allowing hostile behavior. Look for a code of conduct, ask the organizers about this, and take a look at their speaker lineup from previous years. I - like many speakers - believe that <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">conferences should choose speakers that reflect the diversity of the communities they hope to serve</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you start to find conferences that would be a good fit for you, it’s time to write and submit your first abstract. The next section outlines some tips from experienced speakers and conference organizers about how to get your abstract accepted.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\"
