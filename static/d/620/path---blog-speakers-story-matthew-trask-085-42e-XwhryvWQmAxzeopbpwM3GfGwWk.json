At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speakerâ€™s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>I knew about Matthew long before he had ever heard of me, but I was fortunate enough to finally meet him in person at Midwest PHP, 2019. I think our first conversation was awkward nods in the hotel gym, but once that was over, we got to talk throughout the conference.</p>\n<p>In addition to speaking, Matt is an active open source maintainer, and has been giving back to the PHP community in various ways for the past several years. He also speaks on behalf of <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">OSMI</a> - a great organization that helps raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech community - so Iâ€™m excited to present his story about open source, speaking, and engineering.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>During the day Iâ€™m a senior software engineer at a company called MoreCommerce where we do small and medium-sized business e-commerce and market place offerings. Outside of that, I help maintain various API related OSS projects like Fractal, openapi.tools, standards.rest and a few others. I spend most of my free time doing photography or cycling. </p>\n<p>As for speaking, I got my start at my old PHP user group in Atlanta. I started with a lightning talk and moved up to a full-length talk before breaking into a conference. Im usually pretty shy and quiet, so it was weird at first but it been a lot of fun. </p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about speaking is <strong>itâ€™s an excuse to learn and play with new technology</strong>. I wouldnâ€™t have become passionate about the OpenAPI spec if a conference hadnâ€™t given me a chance to speak on it for example. And because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, <strong>giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldnâ€™t touch at work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk?
