We catalog <a href=\"/blog/data\">about 400 per year at CFP Land</a>, but there are even more that we don’t find. If you’re new to the field, you might be surprised that there could be that many events, but as this post elaborates, no two tech conferences are alike. These conferences range in size, topic focus, cost, and competitiveness for speakers.</p>\n<h2>How Do Conferences Differ?</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at a few of the dimensions you might use to compare technology conferences:</p>\n<h3>1. Breadth and Depth</h3>\n<p>If you’re in a narrow specialty, you may not have the opportunity to meet with many similar professionals in your city often. Some conferences cater to these narrow “niches”, and go really deep into a single area of focus.</p>\n<p>Conversely, there are some tech conferences that cover a huge range of technologies and disciplines. These usually last longer and have multiple “tracks” so attendees can choose the talks they are most interested in.</p>\n<h3>2. Tracks</h3>\n<p>“Tracks” are the way most conferences divide up talks by specialty or area of interest. Some tech conferences may have a track for design, another for development, and a third for product managers. Usually these individual tracks are capped off with one or two keynotes which have broad appeal to most attendees.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Single-track conferences can be nice because you’re guaranteed the maximum audience size. However, it also means that there may be people in the audience who don’t care about your talk. With a multi-track conference, the people who do attend your talk will be more interested in what you have to say. But this also brings anxiety or disappointment when not as many people choose your talk as you’d like, and you have to give your talk to an awkwardly small crowd.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Attendees</h3>\n<p>Some niche, regional conferences may attract fewer than 100 attendees. I’ve been to a couple where you didn’t really even need a microphone to reach the whole audience. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are some tech conferences with thousands of attendees who swarm on massive convention centers for days at a time.</p>\n<p>The smaller ones can be nice if you really want to form close relationships with a few people, but sometimes it’s nice to slip into anonymity at a huge conference and not have to see the same 5 people all the time.</p>\n<h3>4. Frequency</h3>\n<p>The majority of tech conferences happen annually, but there are some with bi-annual cadences. Usually these will hold one event in America and the other in Europe to allow attendees on both hemispheres the opportunity to attend.</p>\n<h3>5. Location</h3>\n<p>Conferences don’t necessarily happen in big cities, but it is more common. If people are traveling to attend, it’s usually easier to host the event in a large, central location. That said, there are some conferences that happen in unique venues: a <a href=\"https://www.codercruise.com/\">cruise ship</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.atechconference.com/\">island</a>, or <a href=\"https://nomadphp.com/\">online</a>.</p>\n<h3>6. Corporate vs. Community Run</h3>\n<p>A few large tech companies run their own conferences with the goal of promoting their technology and building a community of users. For example, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite\">Microsoft’s Ignite</a> and <a href=\"https://reinvent.awsevents.com/\">Amazon’s re:Invent</a>. Just because these conferences have a clear agenda doesn’t mean the content isn’t valuable though. Many of us rely on keeping up with the latest technology that these companies release.</p>\n<p>Community run conferences sit at the other end of the spectrum. These events are managed by fans or advocates for a particular language, technology, or project, and are often much lower-budget. Some rely on donations; some partner with sponsors; and others charge attendees.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some conferences are for-profit. Others make little to no money for the organizers, and are largely a labor of love for the community. Some for-profit conferences will masquerade as the latter. Make sure you know what the conference is and if you’re comfortable with it before you accept.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Running a conference is notoriously challenging and expensive. Organizers have to coordinate a lot of details; pay for food, event space, speakers, and staff; find sponsors; sell tickets…the list goes on! If you’re interested in how this all shakes out, <a href=\"https://2019.jsconf.eu/news/the-jsconf-cssconf-eu-finances/\">JS Conf Europe’s organizers wrote an interesting overview of their finances last year</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why Attend?</h2>\n<p>Plenty of experienced technology professionals never go to or speak at a conference. They can be expensive, take away time from focused work, and awkward - especially if you don’t know anyone there. That said, there are some great reasons to try attending a tech conference sometime:</p>\n<h3>1. Learn New Skills</h3>\n<p>The tools available to technology professionals is changing rapidly, and it can be hard to keep up. Newsletters, blogs, and local usergroups are all a great place to turn, but so are conferences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conferences are prime place for learning about new or obscure libraries and packages that you haven’t used before. If it’s been done before, then someone somewhere will eventually give a talk about it.\n<em><a href=\"https://opensource.com/life/16/2/attending-technical-conferences-whats-big-deal\">Deb Nicholson</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>2. Meet New People</h3>\n<p>While attending talks is an obvious way to learn new things at a conference, you may also pick up some new ideas from your fellow attendees. Meeting people at conferences is also a great way to find a job or look for job candidates.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like meeting like-minded people with the profession in common…I like the positive energy conferences have and regardless of where you work or the number of years of experience one has all of the participants are there to learn and share the experience.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-geshan-manandhar/\">Geshan Manandhar</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Be Inspired</h3>\n<p>Great speakers can motivate you; ignite your passions; inspire you to do something you woudn’t have. Not every tech conference has room for a ton of inspirational talks, but many conferences try to include some of these in their keynote slots.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYlT4lU5pb4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>“A Tinker Story” by dina Amin</em></p>\n<h3>4. Have Fun</h3>\n<p>Finally, attending a tech conference can be really fun. Last time I went to <a href=\"https://www.codemash.org/\">Codemash</a>, I got to visit the NASA facilities in Sandusky, Ohio, see the indoor water park, and play virtual reality video games in the arcade for hours after the talks ended.</p>\n<p>If you think attending a tech conference is a great experience, keep reading! Next we’ll learn why you might want to move from the audience to the stage and start speaking at tech conferences too.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../\">Previous: Index</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../why-speak/\">Next: Why Speak? The Reasons People Get on Stage</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"An Introduction to Technology Conferences","path":"/guides/speaking/introduction/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>If you’re considering submitting a conference talk, but you’re not sure if it’s really worth it, read on. In this section, I’ve collected the most common reasons people cite for wanting to speak at conferences.</p>\n<h2>1. Developer Advocates: Professional Technical Speakers</h2>\n<p>I didn’t realize this was a job until I started speaking at conferences and met a few people who did this. “Developer Advocates” (sometimes called DevRels or Developer Evangelists) are paid to get their company’s name out into the public. It’s a lot like marketing, but with a decidedly technical bent.</p>\n<p>Most Developer Advocates still write code, help support the products they work on, and are involved in coming up with and testing new features. Because their job is to be in the public eye, many of them are very prolific speakers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During my first year [in Developer Relations] at Okta…I spoke 37 times, at 20 conferences, in 10 different countries.\n<em><a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/01/28/developer-relations-pro-tips\">Matt Raible</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While an element of their job may require speaking, many also do it for other reasons you’ll read about below.</p>\n<h2>2. Promote a Business or Project</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a good way to boost my career prospects as a technology consultant.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jason-swett/\">Jason Swett</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Small business owners and consultants are always looking for an edge, and for many getting recognition by speaking at conferences is a great opportunity. Not only do they get to make a name for themselves, they may meet people in the audience who actually want to hire them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the connections I’ve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs and new clients.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some developers also use speaking as an excuse to plug open source products they want to support.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try to contribute to some [open source] libraries also, but promoting them on stage feels like the best thing that I’m capable of doing. If something makes my life better, and some people invest their efforts and share it for free — I want to help them to gain exposure.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd\">Oleksandr Tryshchenko</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>3. Help Others</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I’m providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the most common answers I hear from people about why they got into public speaking is their desire to help others. Speaking is rarely a financially lucrative gig, so it’s a good thing that people find fulfillment just by spreading their knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try as much as possible to help other people get into tech, or get better at tech. Knowing I helped at least one person by being on stage and sharing my knowledge makes me feel a bit better about that.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/\">Alex Lakatos</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if a topic has been spoken about before, there are always new people coming into the industry who need to learn about it. Many speakers realize that their unique spin on something might shed new light on it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I’m talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn’t before.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-kara-luton/\">Kara Luton</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there are plenty of other ways to help others out, it is nice to be able to do it en masse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I enjoy being able to share my advice with a lot of people at once. It is like mentoring or giving advice on steroids.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-molly-struve/\">Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>4. Meet People</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s great to be able to speak about the thing you’re interested in in front of a lot of people, because it means for the rest of the conference the other people who share your passion will come up and talk to you.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/\">Nicola Rushton</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I never really started meeting people at conferences until I started speaking at them. Like many software engineers, I get intimidated by large groups of new people, but after speaking, attendees would come up to me and introduce themselves. It took a ton of the pressure off of meeting new people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I think it’s a lot easier to meet people when you’re the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Local meetups are great for seeing friends and meeting people too, but at a conference, you can meet people from around the world. There’s nothing like it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things — not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you do start speaking at conferences, don’t miss out on the chance to meet new people. Even if it’s just a few of the other speakers, take advantage of the connections you can make at conferences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Too many speakers finish their talk and then rush off to catch a plane, or hole themselves up in a hotel room to get back on top of email. If you do this, you’re missing out on one of the most valuable aspects of an event: the networking.”\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>5. Recognition</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/\">Gant Laborde</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of the most active tech conference speakers have built up quite a following. I’m not one of them, but I have had a couple talks where people came up to me later in the conference and said they enjoyed my presentation. I’ve even gotten a few Twitter followers as a result.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Some people have a bunch of Twitter followers and YouTube views, and this seems to make them happy. Building your public brand by speaking at conferences can be a way to work towards this.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, if fame and recognition is your #1 goal, be careful. Some conferences <a href=\"/guides/speaking/how-conferences-choose/\">prefer not to invite the most egotistical speakers</a>.</p>\n<h2>6. Travel</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’ve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places – I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you’re new to speaking at conferences, you might not realize this, but many speakers’ airfare and hotel stays are paid for by the event. I’ve worked with organizers to delay my return date by a day or two (with me picking up the extra hotel nights) so I could visit the city on my own time. This opportunity for free or low-cost travel is a great perk.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not every conference can afford to pay for every speaker to travel, so you’ll have to be picky if this is something you want. All the conferences listed on CFP Land include details about the perks included for speakers, so be sure to <a href=\"/conferences\">check out our list of CFPs</a>.</p>\n<h2>7. Personal Growth</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The more I present the more confident I become in my abilities to do so. This has helped with my social anxiety and with my ability to interact with clients or potential clients.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many software engineers and technology professionals don’t have to interact with customers or lead meetings on a daily basis. This lack of practice speaking in public makes it scary, but many people use conference speaking as a way to overcome this fear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don’t know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-rizwan-javaid/\">Rizwan Javaid</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other people I have talked to cite specific professional opportunities they’ve encountered because of their public speaking efforts. I’ve known several speakers who turned conference talks into books, online courses, or training workshops.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I was given the opportunity to create a course for Lynda.com because I met Lynda.com staff author Ray Villalobos after we both spoke at a conference. It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/\">John Riviello</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/community/experts\">Google Developer Expert program</a> lists “Being an influential and recognized speaker,” as one of its criteria.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>8. Finding a Job</h2>\n<p>In addition to improving your presentation skills and gaining accolades in your field, speaking may even help land you a job. A couple speakers I know have met people at their future employer at conferences as a result of their talks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“During job interviews, I’ve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Making your resume stand out of the hundreds of others like it is tough; having some unique experience like speaking at a conference can really help set you apart.</p>\n<h2>9. The Rush</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects!”\n_<a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-nicolas-frankel/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every time I complete a conference talk, I have a natural high that lasts for a good 2-3 hours. Maybe it’s just the tail end of my nervousness, but speaking can be invigorating.</p>\n<p>Not everyone reacts the same way though. I’ve met speakers who feel the need to run back to their hotel room and sleep after a talk. If you’re more introverted or anxious, the experience of speaking at a conference might just have the opposite effect.</p>\n<h2>10. Advocate a Cause</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’ve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity’s ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While tech conferences may remain <em>mostly</em> a-political, there are plenty of places where technology and social good intersect. Some speakers specialize in this arena.</p>\n<p>For example, Eva PenzyMoog travels around the United States to give her talk about how technology enables certain kinds of domestic abuse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/\">Eva PenzyMoog</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want to make a positive impact on the world, speaking at conferences just might be your outlet.</p>\n<h2>11. Learn New Things</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”[Speaking is] an excuse to learn and play with new technology…Because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn’t touch at work.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A couple years ago, I decided I wanted to learn Docker. I didn’t have much of a case for using it at work, but it seemed like promising technology that would be interesting to learn.</p>\n<p>I dove in head first - I started a couple side projects that used it, wrote <a href=\"https://www.shiphp.com/\">a short book about it</a>, and started pitching talks about it to conferences. This year, I designed a four-hour workshop as well. I’ve found lots of other speakers also use their talks as an opportunity to learn something new.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“When I submit a talk proposal it’s usually on a topic that I am not an expert on, but one that I am interested in learning more about. I then have a motivator to deep dive into the topic to learn about it.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many conference talks include live coding or demonstrations, which are also a good excuse to play with new technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Building demos can really help you with learning the ins and outs on a topic and you never know what you may uncover.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">Tae’lur Alexis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s even research that indicates that <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-01-24-want-students-to-remember-what-they-learn-have-them-teach-it\">teaching a subject is one of the best ways to learn it</a>. If you have to break things down to a point where someone at any experience level can digest it, you’re going to have to understand the concept pretty well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“While writing talks are a huge time commitment, there is nothing quite like explaining a concept to others to help crystalize it in your mind.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laurie-barth/\">Laurie Barth</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully the reasons above have convinced you that speaking at conferences is a worthwhile endeavor. Next, we’ll dive into how conferences choose speakers and learn about the “Call for Proposals” process.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../introduction\">Previous: An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../how-conferences-choose/\">Next: How Conferences Choose Their Speakers</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Why Speak? 11 Reasons People Get on Stage","path":"/guides/speaking/why-speak/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Once you’re very well established as a technology conference speaker, you might start getting invited to speak, but for most speakers, this takes a long time if it happens at all. The reality is that conferences typically get many more speakers interested than they have slots, so they almost always hold an open “Call for Proposals” or CFP.</p>\n<p><em>For more detail on how conferences select speakers, check out <a href=\"../how-conferences-choose/\">Section 3: How Conferences Choose Their Speakers</a></em></p>\n<p>Before you can submit any CFPs though, you’ll need to find them. In this section, we’ll look at various methods for finding conferences with open calls for proposals and selecting those that are worth your time.</p>\n<h2>Finding CFPs</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP).”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/\">Jaime Lopez</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are several ways that you can find out about CFPs:</p>\n<h3>1. Contact the Conference Directly</h3>\n<p>If you are focused on just a few specific conferences, you could reach out directly to each of them to express your interest in submitting. Many conferences start planning 6 months before the event, so they might be looking for CFPs early. That said, some organizers may not start working until 3 months before the event, or they might not have time to answer every email individually. In this case, you’ll end up spending a lot of time chasing them.</p>\n<p>In most cases, it’s unnecessary to ask a conference directly when their CFP will open as they’ll probably post something about it on their website. But, it’s worth mentioning because some conferences never hold an open CFP, so you have to reach out directly.</p>\n<h3>2. Subscribe to the Conference’s Website or Newsletter</h3>\n<p>Assuming the conference holds an open CFP, they’re likely to tell as many people as they can about it in their blog or newsletter. If you’re targeting a few specific conferences, this might be the best way to ensure you don’t miss their CFPs. Be careful counting on conference newsletters too much though. Some organizers are not very good at sending them, and they may forget to publicize their CFP that way.</p>\n<p>It will be annoying to check every conference website you’re interested in submitting to every few weeks, but it may be the only way to ensure you don’t miss a certain CFP.</p>\n<h3>3. Social Media</h3>\n<p>Twitter is probably the most popular social network for technology conferences and speakers, so you may want to start following people there. Following individual conferences will get you started, but there are a number of good accounts that tweet out about open CFPs. You can also save a few Twitter searches to accomplish this goal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">Tae’lur Alexis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Use a CFP Aggregator</h3>\n<p>I’m biased towards this one - <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/how-cfpland-came-to-be/\">that’s why I started CFP Land</a> - but it’s also the most convenient method if you want to apply to speak at a lot of conferences. <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, <a href=\"https://confs.tech/\">Confs.tech</a>, and <a href=\"https://callingallpapers.com/\">CallingAllPapers</a> are the most comprehensive CFP aggregators, but there are other niche topic aggregators as well. At CFP Land, we add the perks that speakers can expect from the conference, but you could also look that information up yourself on each conference’s website.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these aggregators have a list of open CFPs and some of them offer a newsletter or email alerts as well. The biggest downside to a CFP aggregator is that you’re bound to miss some conferences that they aren’t aware of. I’ve collected over 1200 conference CFPs in the past two years, but every month subscribers submit dozens of new ones that I didn’t know existed.</p>\n<h2>Deciding Which CFPs to Submit to</h2>\n<p>As you start learning more about the wide array of conferences out there, you’ll discover that there are likely more open CFPs than you have time to submit to. Every speaker must decide which conferences are worth their time, so while you may not be as picky when you’re just getting started, it’s certainly worth considering the following criteria with each CFP.</p>\n<h3>1. Topic Area</h3>\n<p>You don’t have to have a complete talk ready before you start submitting abstracts to open Calls for Proposals, but you should have some idea what kind of topics you want to speak about. While conferences will usually look for a range of talks, you are never going to get a Ruby talk accepted to a Python conference. Plus, as Nick points out, that Python conference may not be interesting to you anyway:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Maybe you can get your talk on web accessibility accepted at DjangoCon, but if you aren’t interested in Python, then the rest of the conference will be of minimal value to you.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most conferences will provide information about the topics and kinds of talks they want on the CFP page, but if they don’t take a look at videos or listings of the previous year’s talks. This should give you some idea what they are looking for.</p>\n<h3>2. Location</h3>\n<p>One of the first conferences I spoke at was Codemash, and while I loved the event, traveling to Sandusky, Ohio in January is not always pleasant. As you look for conferences, you may want to prioritize those in locations that would be fun to visit or where you have friends or coworkers.</p>\n<p>I’ve actually spoken at some conferences that did not pay for my hotel because I had a friend in town I could stay with anyway. This makes it easier for the conference to support you financially, plus I got to hang out with an old college friend who lives on the other side of the country.</p>\n<h3>3. Financial Viability</h3>\n<p>Getting accepted to speak at a conference in Thailand may sound great, but if they don’t cover your flight costs, you might be paying several thousand dollars just to get there. Most conferences will list the speaker perks they offer on their website, but if not, you can email the organizers directly to ask. In my experience, about 30% of tech conferences cover travel and hotel costs for their speakers, and about 1% offer an extra stipend.</p>\n<p>Another way to fund your speaking excursion might be to turn to your employer. Some companies offer an education budget to employees, and attending a conference - even as a speaker - is certainly an educational experience. You could also make the argument that you’ll help your employer raise awareness of their product or any open job listings while you’re there. It may or may not work, but it’s worth trying.</p>\n<p>Finally, many conferences offer other perks to speakers - whether they can cover travel or not. For example, I’ve seen conferences offer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free speaker training sessions</li>\n<li>Airport transportation</li>\n<li>Speaker’s dinner</li>\n<li>Gift bags or cards for speakers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these add-ons may help make speaking more financially viable, but to be honest, most new speakers will not get paid much for their speaking directly.</p>\n<h3>4. Reputation</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not all conferences are born equal: whether you like it or not, there’s a “coolness” factor attached to each of them.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether you call it “coolness” or “reputation” or “prestige”, it’s true that not all conferences hold the same weight. Many smaller, regional conferences are more like a big meetup, so speaking there may not be that difficult. On the other hand, some huge tech events are extremely competitive and aim to only accept world-class speakers. Either way, there’s no harm in applying to speak at a conference that you feel is “above your pay grade.” The only way to move up is to go for it!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I recommend looking at videos from prior years and looking at the conference website, to see if it appears to be the work of conscientious, detail-oriented, experienced people.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you may start by applying at smaller, newer conferences, it is a good idea to look into how the conference has been run in the past. Do they treat their speakers and attendees well? Are the organizers well-known? Do they have a good reputation? Ask around if you don’t know anyone who’s been to the event personally.</p>\n<p>Finally, consider whether or not you want to take a risk by speaking at a first time conference. I have had good and bad experiences with new events: one had to cancel the event due to lack of interest, and the other was an awesome conference run by very professional and experienced people. Talk to the organizers and do what you can to understand their vision for the event.</p>\n<h3>5. Commitment to Diversity</h3>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, you should know whether the event has a commitment to diversity and will provide a welcoming environment for all attendees and speakers. You don’t want to be attached to an event that gets bad press for excluding people or allowing hostile behavior. Look for a code of conduct, ask the organizers about this, and take a look at their speaker lineup from previous years. I - like many speakers - believe that <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">conferences should choose speakers that reflect the diversity of the communities they hope to serve</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you start to find conferences that would be a good fit for you, it’s time to write and submit your first abstract. The next section outlines some tips from experienced speakers and conference organizers about how to get your abstract accepted.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\"
