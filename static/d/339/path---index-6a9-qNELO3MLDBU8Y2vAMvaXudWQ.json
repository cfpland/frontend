This week, I’m featuring my interview with Denise Yu, a\nSenior Software Engineer at GitHub who has found speaking to be a great springboard for her career in tech.</p>\n<p>Like many speakers I’ve talked to over the past year, Denise comes from a nontraditional background, and is deeply passionate about helping\nother speakers get their starts. She also included some great recommendations for other speakers to watch, so be sure\nto look for that section towards the end.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m about to start a job as a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub, working on the Community &#x26; Safety team. I previously worked at Pivotal in their Cloud R&#x26;D business, where I wrote lots of YAML and pair-programmed everyday.</p>\n<p>I make tech art — mostly, doodling things quickly when I’m watching people speak at conferences, but also cat-related doodles of technical concepts, at <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/art/\">deniseyu.io/art</a>. I started public speaking when I was about 12 years old, because at that time I thought I wanted to grow up and become a lawyer. I joined my school’s debate club, and spent about the next 12 years participating, judging, teaching, and facilitating competitive debate, Model UN, Mock Trial, and lots of other speaking-related extracurricular activities.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>For me, technical speaking has been a pretty significant career accelerator. I’ve met gracious and talented engineers who I consider to be mentors and sponsors, and <strong>I’ve been able to network my way into every single job I’ve taken, after my first job in tech, either as a direct or indirect result of my participation in public speaking at meetups and conferences. There’s no such thing as being too junior when you’re brave enough to get up in front of an audience and share what you know.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking has never officially been part of my job, but I’ve been lucky to have had employers who supported my speaking endeavors by granting me paid time off to travel to conferences.</p>\n<h3>What makes distributed systems such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>I career-switched and didn’t study computer science in undergrad, so I have a persistent sense of imposter syndrome around missing out on foundational knowledge.</p>\n<p>I started becoming interested in the mechanics of distributed computing while debugging RabbitMQ issues in production a few years ago. I can’t remember the specifics now, but a customer experienced a network partition, and the RabbitMQ cluster nodes came back to life in an unexpected order, which caused a host of unexpected side effects.</p>\n<p>I had such poor understanding of the design decisions for partition recovery strategies, that I decided to start doing my own research, and uncovered a world of deep, deep academic research into resilience engineering for distributed systems. For someone with no computer science background, I found the reading material out there to be targeted at advanced practitioners, and it was so difficult to me to get started on learning about distsys, so I did the reasonable thing, which was to submit a talk proposal to DevOpsDays London promising to compare partition recovery strategies between a few popular open-source databases. (Side note: This was not a reasonable thing to do.)</p>\n<p>While I was writing this talk, I was also reading Martin Kleppmann’s book “Designing Data-Intensive Applications”, and I realized that before I could even talk about network partition recovery strategies, I had to spend a significant amount of time laying groundwork around why these strategies even needed to exist in the first place. The talk evolved from “RabbitMQ vs. Kafka vs. Cassandra” into a more general discussion of why distributed systems are so hard to understand, operate, and maintain. I think that as this talk has further iterated and evolved, the constant thread has been that distributed systems are difficult to learn about, and there is always space to revisit the fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I spoke at was SwanseaCon in 2017. I delivered a talk titled “Building Empowered Teams at Scale”. I am not sure if it was recorded, but <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/talks\">the slides are available on my website</a>.</p>\n<p>I pitched the talk because in my first few months at Pivotal, I saw that the product teams were so much more empowered to make their own decisions, than previous teams I’d worked on, and I thought that some pieces of our philosophy around building and managing teams would be interesting to share with the world.</p>\n<p><strong>I was terrified - not about presenting in public, but specifically about speaking to a room full of engineers who knew a lot more about software and organizations than I did.</strong> I remember being so nervous about the talk that I started writing it seven months in advance. My manager helped me connect with people in leadership within the org to interview about their perspectives — which actually ended up being a really cool way to build rapport with very senior-level folks that I didn’t have day-to-day contact with.</p>\n<p>I think the talk went well - to be honest, my brain completely blurs out the exact memories of being on stage usually - but I was proud that I had pushed myself to pitch, create, and deliver a full-length conference talk, about 2.5 years into my career in tech so far.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I’ve spoken at upwards of 20 conferences. I’ve applied to more - I think I applied to 10 conferences last year and got accepted to 7. This year I’ve been recycling talks and being less ambitious about submitting, because I’m switching jobs and want to invest my energy in getting ramped up.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>When I develop a new talk, I spend a lot of time doing research. I actually <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/2018/09/24/writing-tech-talks.html\">blogged about my process here</a>!</p>\n<p>As a former debate kid, <strong>the key thing that’s always worked for me is practicing in front of diverse test audiences before the big day.</strong> When I lived in London and was developing new talks regularly, I had a crew of tech friends who didn’t work with me at Pivotal, and I’d invite them over, cook them dinner, feed them wine and beer, and run my talk for them and ask for feedback. This always caught “Pivotal-isms” that I subconsciously put in, and it’d be a good way to level-set about whether my talk made sense to people who didn’t work on the same types of software that I did.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I also have decks on this! I sometimes help local meetups with training new speaker and drumming up talk submissions for CFPs. <a href=\"https://deniseyu.io/techtalks\">Here’s the 15-minute deck that I usually run</a>.</p>\n<p>For new speakers, particularly folks with non-linear trajectories into the tech industry like myself, I always tell them this: <strong>Your story is interesting. You have a unique voice and set of experiences, and someone out there wants to hear your story.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s great to get started with smaller and lower-pressure speaking environments like meetups and possibly even presenting to bootcamp students or university student groups.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQrNOMO7UDk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>”<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQrNOMO7UDk\">How to Tech Talk</a>” by Denise Yu</em></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I was really excited to hear from Bruce Lawson because HTML is such a core piece of technology for\nthe web, but so many of us take it for granted. As a member of the W3C’s HTML5.3 specification team and writer on the topic, I knew\nBruce would make for an interesting speaker to feature here.</p>\n<p>Read on to hear about Bruce’s wide-ranging experience from music to acting to accessibility, and some of his tips for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m an accessibility and web standards consultant (<a href=\"https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/\">you can hire me!</a>). Side projects are music: <a href=\"https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/category/my-music/\">writing and recording</a> and developing a new product called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swordcello\">SwordCello</a>, which isn’t released yet. I got into public speaking as a kid, when I was an actor.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>It used to be an integral part of my job in Developer Relations for Opera, now it’s for fun - it’s a good way of seeing old friends or visiting a new city. It’s definitely benefited my career, and hopefully helped my audience’s careers, too.</p>\n<h3>What makes HTML such an interesting topic for you?</h3>\n<p>HTML is the foundational language of the web: the greatest store of knowledge (and bullshit) ever. It’s forwards and backwards compatible. It’s developed to be accessible, work with any human language or script and to be secure.

But it was very dry.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Ooh, about 150 I think. I probably only applied to about 10; the rest were invitations from the conference organiser.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Safety pee; check zip is up; make sure you have water (not sparkling, else you might burp down the mic). Go through your slides one last time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Even if you think your subject has been spoken about before, you’re bringing your own unique slant to it.</li>\n<li>Make sure you tell a story - you have a beginning, middle and end.</li>\n<li>Don’t spend ages introducing yourself.</li>\n<li>Never claim something is easy or obvious, just because it is to you.</li>\n<li>Put in a few jokes.</li>\n<li>Relax. If you dry up and can’t remember the next bit, take a sip of water so you don’t feel like a deer in the headlights.</li>\n<li>Don’t take questions; tell the audience that you’ll be around the venue and they are more than welcome to approach you and ask you questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

After gathering feedback from hundreds of technology conference speakers, I realized that like me, many of them struggled to find and keep up with which CFPs were available and which ones they had applied to. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to make sure CFP Land was self-sustaining, so CFP Land Pro was born.</p>\n<p>If you’re considering a <a href=\"/members/\">Pro Membership</a>, read on to learn more about everything that’s included. Don’t hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:info@cfpland.com\">email me</a> if you have questions about how CFP Land can help you be a more successful speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2><span id=\"early-access\">1. Early Access to CFPs</span></h2>\n<p>The weekly CFP Land newsletter and <a href=\"/conferences/\">our free conference listings</a> show all CFPs that close in the next 21 days. Usually this is plenty of time to apply, but many conferences review applicants on a rolling basis. In those cases, <strong>applying as early as possible is advantageous</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular features among Pro Members is the early access to CFPs. If you’re not a Pro Member already, you won’t see any conferences tagged <code class=\"language-text\">⬆️ Pro</code> in your feed, but if you sign up for a Pro Membership, here’s what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png\" alt=\"Pro Members get access to CFPs 21 days before free members\"></a></p>\n<p>As a Pro Member, you can see all the CFPs in our database that are closing in the next <strong>42 days</strong>, meaning you’ll be able to apply much earlier than free users.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"save-cfps\">2. Save CFPs</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/save-cfps-1.gif\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Save conferences to be reminded before they close\"></a></p>\n<p>It’s easy to lose track of which CFPs you want to submit when there are hundreds each month on CFP Land alone. <strong>Saving CFPs is a great way to keep up with the conferences that you care about most.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you save a CFP to your Pro account, you’ll get email reminders 21, 7, and 3 days before it closes. This is great if you’re browsing CFPs on mobile, but you don’t want to forget to submit to them when you’re back at your computer.</p>\n<p>Another useful reason to save CFPs is to personalize your feed of upcoming Calls for Proposals. By default, there may be 50 to 100 open CFPs on the “All” page, so saving CFPs will ensure you don’t have to wade through quite as many irrelevant conferences.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"export-cfps\">3. Export CFPs to Your Personal Calendar</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/export-cfps-2.gif\" alt=\"Using CFP Land Pro to export conferences to your calendar\"></a></p>\n<p>You don’t have to track your CFPs in CFP Land. Pro Members also get a calendar export tool that allows you to save CFPs to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook.</p>\n<p>This is helpful if you want to create custom reminders or use your own calendar notifications rather than the CFP Land emails.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"search-alerts\">4. Custom Search Alerts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-2.gif\" alt=\"Saving searches with your CFP Land Pro Membership\"></a></p>\n<p>All CFP Land users can use filters to search for conferences that match their preferences, but if you’re a free user, you will need to check the site periodically to make sure you don’t miss any new opportunities. In order to make your life a little easier, <strong>CFP Land Pro Members can save their searches to get an email alert when new CFPs are found that match their filters.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-3.png\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Email alert when results from a saved search are found\" /></a></p>\n<p>When a new conference CFP is found that matches one of your saved searches, you’ll get an email about it, letting you know that you can either <a href=\"/blog/pro-saving-cfps/\">Save the CFP</a> or apply right away.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you’ll never miss another great CFP once you set up your searches on <a href=\"/members/\">CFP Land Pro</a>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"abstracts\">5. Save Your Abstracts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/abstracts.png\" alt=\"Abstracts on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Most experienced speakers have a pool of abstracts that they could submit depending on the audience and conference focus. CFP Land Pro Members can save those Abstracts to their CFP Land account so that they can tie them to each CFP they submit.</p>\n<p>This is a great way to see which of your abstracts is the most successful and to remember which Abstract you submitted to which conference.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"track\">6. Track Your Submissions</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/track.gif\" alt=\"Track submissions on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Finally, if you submit dozens of Abstracts per year, it can be hard to keep up with all of them. In my first year of speaking, I used a giant spreadsheet to track over 50 submissions, and it got to be a huge mess.</p>\n<p>CFP Land Pro Members can track the conferences they’ve applied to, been accepted at, and been rejected from in addition to attaching their Abstracts to each submission.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Much more will be coming soon, so if you’re interested, <a href=\"/members/\">your CFP Land Pro Membership is just a few clicks away</a>!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Pro Members Only: A Complete List of All the Features CFP Land Pro Members Get","path":"/blog/pro-features/","category":"Updates","tags":["Pro Features"],"date":"2020/02/07","image":"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png"}}}]},"guides":{"all":[{"guide":{"html":"<p>While running CFP Land I’ve had the opportunity to <a href=\"/blog/\">meet with and learn from dozens of speakers around the world</a>.
