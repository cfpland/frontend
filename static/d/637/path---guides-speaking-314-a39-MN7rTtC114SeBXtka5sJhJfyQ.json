The community has been amazingly welcoming and helpful, so I wanted to give some of this knowledge back by releasing a comprehensive guide to speaking at technology conferences.</p>\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"./speaking/introduction/\">An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"./speaking/why-speak/\">Why Speak?

I’ve compiled and organized hundreds of pieces of advice from over 30 interviews I’ve done with speakers as well as some of the blog posts recommended to me along the way.</p>\n<p>Because everyone reading this will start at a different level of experience speaking, you can either jump straight to the section you find most relevant using the Table of Contents above, or read all the sections sequentially by looking for the “Next” link at the bottom of each page.  </p>\n<p>As you read through these chapters, you may have your own ideas or resources to suggest. That’s great! I’d love to continue refining and building this guide with help from the community. Just <a href=\"mailto:info@cfpland.com\">shoot me an email</a> with the tips you’d like to add, and I’ll keep updating this resource.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-right\" href=\"./speaking/introduction/\">Next: An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"The Comprehensive Guide to Speaking at Technology Conferences in 2020","path":"/guides/speaking/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
