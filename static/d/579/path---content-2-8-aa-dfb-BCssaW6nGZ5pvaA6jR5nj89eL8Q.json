Developer Advocates: Professional Technical Speakers</h2>\n<p>I didn’t realize this was a job until I started speaking at conferences and met a few people who did this. “Developer Advocates” (sometimes called DevRels or Developer Evangelists) are paid to get their company’s name out into the public. It’s a lot like marketing, but with a decidedly technical bent.</p>\n<p>Most Developer Advocates still write code, help support the products they work on and are involved in coming up with and testing new features. Because their job is to be in the public eye, many of them are very prolific speakers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During my first year [in Developer Relations] at Okta…I spoke 37 times, at 20 conferences, in 10 different countries.\n<em><a href=\"https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/01/28/developer-relations-pro-tips\">Matt Raible</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While an element of their job may require speaking, many also do it for other reasons you’ll read about below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eHIEzXQ.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>2. Promote a Business or Project</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a good way to boost my career prospects as a technology consultant.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jason-swett/\">Jason Swett</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Small business owners and consultants are always looking for an edge, and for many getting recognition by speaking at conferences is a great opportunity. Not only do they get to make a name for themselves, but they may also meet people in the audience who actually want to hire them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of the connections I’ve made at conferences and meetups have definitely helped me land further speaking gigs and new clients.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some developers also use speaking as an excuse to plug open source products they want to support.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try to contribute to some [open source] libraries also, but promoting them on stage feels like the best thing that I’m capable of doing. If something makes my life better, and some people invest their efforts and share it for free — I want to help them to gain exposure.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd\">Oleksandr Tryshchenko</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>3. Help Others</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I’m providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the most common answers I hear from people about why they got into public speaking is their desire to help others. Speaking is rarely a financially lucrative gig, so it’s a good thing that people find fulfillment just by spreading their knowledge.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try as much as possible to help other people get into tech, or get better at tech. Knowing I helped at least one person by being on stage and sharing my knowledge makes me feel a bit better about that.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/\">Alex Lakatos</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if a topic has been spoken about before, there are always new people coming into the industry who need to learn about it. Many speakers realize that their unique spin on something might shed new light on it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I’m talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn’t before.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-kara-luton/\">Kara Luton</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there are plenty of other ways to help others out, it is nice to be able to do it en masse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I enjoy being able to share my advice with a lot of people at once. It is like mentoring or giving advice on steroids.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-molly-struve/\">Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>4. Meet People</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s great to be able to speak about the thing you’re interested in in front of a lot of people, because it means for the rest of the conference the other people who share your passion will come up and talk to you.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/\">Nicola Rushton</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I never really started meeting people at conferences until I started speaking at them. Like many software engineers, I get intimidated by large groups of new people, but after speaking, attendees would come up to me and introduce themselves. It took a ton of the pressure off of meeting new people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think it’s a lot easier to meet people when you’re the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Local meetups are great for seeing friends and meeting people too, but at a conference, you can meet people from around the world. There’s nothing like it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things — not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you do start speaking at conferences, don’t miss out on the chance to meet new people. Even if it’s just a few of the other speakers, take advantage of the connections you can make at conferences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Too many speakers finish their talk and then rush off to catch a plane, or hole themselves up in a hotel room to get back on top of email. If you do this, you’re missing out on one of the most valuable aspects of an event: the networking.”\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>5. Recognition</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There’s something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/\">Gant Laborde</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of the most active tech conference speakers have built up quite a following. I’m not one of them, but I have had a couple of talks where people came up to me later in the conference and said they enjoyed my presentation. I’ve even gotten a few Twitter followers as a result.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Some people have a bunch of Twitter followers and YouTube views, and this seems to make them happy. Building your public brand by speaking at conferences can be a way to work towards this.”\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, if fame and recognition is your #1 goal, be careful. Some conferences <a href=\"/guides/speaking/how-conferences-choose/\">prefer not to invite the most egotistical speakers</a>.</p>\n<h2>6. Travel</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I’ve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places – I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/\">Bailey Lewis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZeztrR6.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>If you’re new to speaking at conferences, you might not realize this, but many speakers’ airfare and hotel stays are paid for by the event. I’ve worked with organizers to delay my return date by a day or two (with me picking up the extra hotel nights) so I could visit the city on my own time. This opportunity for free or low-cost travel is a great perk.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not every conference can afford to pay for every speaker to travel, so you’ll have to be picky if this is something you want. All the conferences listed on CFP Land include details about the perks included for speakers, so be sure to <a href=\"/conferences\">check out our list of CFPs</a>.</p>\n<h2>7. Personal Growth</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The more I present the more confident I become in my abilities to do so. This has helped with my social anxiety and with my ability to interact with clients or potential clients.”\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many software engineers and technology professionals don’t have to interact with customers or lead meetings on a daily basis. This lack of practice speaking in public makes it scary, but many people use conference speaking as a way to overcome this fear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don’t know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-rizwan-javaid/\">Rizwan Javaid</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Others I have talked to cite specific professional opportunities they’ve encountered because of their public speaking efforts. I’ve known several speakers who turned conference talks into books, online courses, or training workshops.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was given the opportunity to create a course for Lynda.com because I met Lynda.com staff author Ray Villalobos after we both spoke at a conference. It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/\">John Riviello</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/community/experts\">Google Developer Expert program</a> lists “Being an influential and recognized speaker,” as one of its criteria.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>8. Finding a Job</h2>\n<p>In addition to improving your presentation skills and gaining accolades in your field, speaking may even help land you a job. A couple of speakers I know have met people at their future employer at conferences as a result of their talks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During job interviews, I’ve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Making your resume stand out of the hundreds of others like it is tough; having some unique experience like speaking at a conference can really help set you apart.</p>\n<h2>9. The Rush</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Public speaking is very energizing, probably similar to drugs, but with no bad side-effects!\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-nicolas-frankel/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every time I complete a conference talk, I have a natural high that lasts for a good 2-3 hours. Maybe it’s just the tail end of my nervousness, but speaking can be invigorating.</p>\n<p>Not everyone reacts the same way though. I’ve met speakers who feel the need to run back to their hotel room and sleep after a talk. If you’re more introverted or anxious, the experience of speaking at a conference might just have the opposite effect.</p>\n<h2>10. Advocate a Cause</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity’s ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While tech conferences may remain <em>mostly</em> a-political, there are plenty of places where technology and social good intersect. Some speakers specialize in this arena.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aslvVbP.jpg\"></p>\n<p>For example, Eva PenzyMoog travels around the United States to give her talk about how technology enables certain kinds of domestic abuse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/\">Eva PenzyMoog</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want to make a positive impact on the world, speaking at conferences just might be your outlet.</p>\n<h2>11. Learn New Things</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Speaking is] an excuse to learn and play with new technology…Because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn’t touch at work.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A couple of years ago, I decided I wanted to learn Docker. I didn’t have much of a case for using it at work, but it seemed like promising technology that would be interesting to learn.</p>\n<p>I dove in headfirst - I started a couple of side projects that used it, wrote <a href=\"https://www.shiphp.com/\">a short book about it</a>, and started pitching talks about it to conferences. This year, I designed a four-hour workshop as well. I’ve found lots of other speakers also use their talks as an opportunity to learn something new.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I submit a talk proposal it’s usually on a topic that I am not an expert on, but one that I am interested in learning more about. I then have a motivator to deep dive into the topic to learn about it.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many conference talks include live coding or demonstrations, which are also a good excuse to play with new technology.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Building demos can really help you with learning the ins and outs on a topic and you never know what you may uncover.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/\">Tae’lur Alexis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s even research that indicates that <a href=\"https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-01-24-want-students-to-remember-what-they-learn-have-them-teach-it\">teaching a subject is one of the best ways to learn it</a>. If you have to break things down to a point where someone at any experience level can digest it, you’re going to have to understand the concept pretty well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While writing talks are a huge time commitment, there is nothing quite like explaining a concept to others to help crystalize it in your mind.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laurie-barth/\">Laurie Barth</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully, the reasons above have convinced you that speaking at conferences is a worthwhile endeavor. Next, we’ll dive into how conferences choose speakers and learn about the “Call for Proposals” process.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../introduction\">Previous: An Introduction to Technology Conferences</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../how-conferences-choose/\">Next: How Conferences Choose Their Speakers</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Why Speak? 11 Reasons People Get on Stage","path":"/guides/speaking/why-speak/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ULa0I4_bXG3XJnXas6PaFhcuy1T6ujLa"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>After being accepted to give your conference talk, the next big step is to create your presentation.

Your talk may not fit perfectly into any one of these archetypes, but it’s helpful to start off with one of these formats and then branch out as your talk matures.</p>\n<h3>1. A novel solution to a common problem</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a new framework becomes popular, there’s often a variety of opinions about the best way to do automated testing for code that uses it. Even if your solution isn’t the best, it can become a standard if you’re the first with a conference video.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the fun things about working in technology today is that there are always new and (arguably) better solutions coming out for various problems. Most new solutions are viable candidates for a conference talk, so this format is pretty common.</p>\n<p>While the specifics vary, a typical presentation of this format might start off by introducing a problem, then talk about existing solutions, and finally give the audience a new (and again arguably better) solution.</p>\n<p>In the talk below, Pete Hunt introduces React by walking through several of the problems that the framework aims to solve. While an introductory talk on React probably won’t get much interest at a conference now, in 2013 React was brand new, so this talk was very popular.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7cQ3mrcKaY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>React: Rethinking best practices by Pete Hunt</em></p>\n<h3>2. The hero’s journey</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They learn that hey, this is hard, and it’s ok to struggle. This person, who must be smart because they’re up there on the stage, makes mistakes. I make mistakes too, so we’re kind of similar. They conquered their problem, so maybe I can conquer mine.\n<em><a href=\"http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks\">Jeff Casimir</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A common pattern for storytelling is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey\">the hero’s journey</a>. You may not have heard this term, but you’ve definitely seen it played out in hundreds of movies, TV shows, and books. The way it works in a conference talk is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You introduce yourself in a happy initial state,</li>\n<li>Something happens that upsets your initial state,</li>\n<li>You reluctantly start a journey to resolve the conflict,</li>\n<li>You reach a low point when your initial assumption fails,</li>\n<li>And finally, you emerge victorious by solving the problem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are variations on this theme, but if your talk is meant to be more personal or story-driven, this is a good format to use.</p>\n<p>Hero’s Journey Illustration: <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/Bv2Quqe.png\">https://i.imgur.com/Bv2Quqe.png</a></p>\n<p>In the talk below, TJ VanToll walks the audience through his process of changing his mind about Typescript. Along the way, we learn about the language and why it’s ultimately superior in some cases.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6rdLx2LYz8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Why I Was Wrong About TypeScript by TJ VanToll</em></p>\n<h3>3. The tech-heavy deep dive</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These talks focus on something that’s cool but that not many engineers get to work with on a day to day basis.\n<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot of tech people like technical deep dives because they’re inspiring. Most of us don’t use all the cutting edge technology available day-to-day, so we appreciate hearing from those who do.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this structure of talk can show people how to use things better that they may already know at a surface level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of my favorite forms is the deep dive. This is what I might call the Pat Shaughnessy talk. It’s been a long time since I studied undergrad Computer Science, and I didn’t understand a lot of it the first time around.\n<em><a href=\"http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks\">Jeff Casimir</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here’s one of Pat Shaughnessy’s talks - a deep dive into ActiveRecord. While most Ruby on Rails developers at the conference have used ActiveRecord, most of them probably don’t know exactly how it works under the hood, so they get a lot of value out of learning these mysterious internals.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rnLnRPZZ1Q4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under ActiveRecord by Pat Shaughnessy</em></p>\n<h3>4. The live demo</h3>\n<p>Live demos are among the most impressive (when they work) and the most underwhelming (when they don’t) talks I’ve ever seen at a conference.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, live coding a working application and showing the audience the results is a great way to illustrate how easy a new framework or tool can be. It’s inspiring and impressive to watch, and you’ll get some big “oohs” and “ahhs” when it goes perfectly.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it rarely goes perfectly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Have backups. If your demo breaks on stage, revert to showing the video of the same thing in action.”\n<em><a href=\"https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp\">Tomasz Lakomy</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I saw one live coding talk where the presenter accidentally deleted his whole template and all his notes just minutes before the talk. He was so flustered that he had to bow out early and apologize for being ill-prepared. That’s probably the worst-case scenario.</p>\n<p>If you do choose to attempt a live demo have a robust backup plan, practice a ton, and make sure you can test it out on the same equipment you’ll use for the actual presentation.</p>\n<p>In this example, Andrew Sorensen live codes a concert for his audience. While he’s working, he explains what’s happening and never drops a note. Best of all, he keeps the whole show to a tight 10-minute time slot. This is really impressive, and I can’t imagine how much preparation has gone into it.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yY1FSsUV-8c' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>The Concert Programmer by Andrew Sorensen</em></p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Conference Presentation Tools</h2>\n<p>Once you land on a format for your talk, you’ll need to decide which tools you want to use to give the presentation. I’d recommend using the tools you’re most familiar with until you get really comfortable speaking on stage. Once you’ve done this a few times, you can try to get creative, but don’t buck the system your first time.</p>\n<h3>1. Slides</h3>\n<p>Most talks center around a slideshow. PowerPoint and Google Slides are probably the most common options, but <a href=\"https://prezi.com/\">Prezi</a> and <a href=\"https://revealjs.com/#/\">Reveal</a> are also good choices. Again, start with the tools you’re most comfortable with and experiment later.</p>\n<h3>2. Audio-Visual Aids</h3>\n<p>Some speakers like to show short video clips during their presentation. If you do this, be very certain you know the audio will work once it’s up on the big screen. There’s nothing worse than trying to put the microphone near your tiny laptop speakers to amplify the sound.</p>\n<h3>3. Microphone</h3>\n<p>Generally, the conference will provide a microphone if it’s necessary, but I’ve met a few speakers who bring their own because they want to be sure it’s a device they’re used to. The downside to this is that you’ll have to coordinate with the conference’s AV team, and some conferences may not make special accommodations like this.</p>\n<h3>4. Remote</h3>\n<p>I like to walk around while I’m on stage, so when possible, I bring a remote to advance my slides. You can get one for cheap online, or you could try to use a wireless mouse in a pinch. Most conferences don’t provide this for you.</p>\n<h3>5. Laptop</h3>\n<p>Finally, you’ll likely need a device to present from. While occasionally conferences will provide one, most prefer you connect your own before you speak. Be sure your battery will last for the duration of your talk and don’t count on a charger being available.</p>\n<p>I mention all these accessories here because you probably want to practice with the same devices you use for the real thing.</p>\n<h2>Building Your Presentation</h2>\n<p>Much of the same advice that applies when <a href=\"../submitting/\">writing your abstract</a> also applies when creating your presentation, but I’d like to point out a few key tips for creating your slide deck and delivering your presentation.</p>\n<h3>1. Mix stories and information</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stories, metaphors, examples, jokes, pictures, videos and other props are all excellent ways to keep things interesting, but make sure that they clearly relate to your core takeaways.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No matter what format you use for your presentation, the best ones are a mix of stories and factual guidance or information. The most common weakness that technology speakers present is not including any interesting anecdotes to help capture their audience’s attention.</p>\n<p>Every speaker and talk is different, but as you build your presentation, make sure that you’re weaving in stories that illustrate your points.</p>\n<h3>2. Use slides for illustrations</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People can only process one inbound message at a time. They will either listen to you or read your slides; they cannot do both.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.duarte.com/wean-yourself-from-presentation-slides/\">Mark Duarte</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another common mistake speakers make is to fill every slide with bullet points. Because your audience can only listen <em>or</em> read, you should be very careful with the amount of text you cram into a slide.</p>\n<p>This can be a hard habit to break, but it might help to set up speaker notes so that you can look at your bullet points while your audience can actually listen to you or look at an image that frames your topic on the screen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your slides only really serve three good purposes: entertainment, illustration, and roadmap. Anything else is distracting your audience from listening to you.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67\">Cassie Kozyrkov</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. First and last slides</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I always set the conference logo on the cover slide. The people behind the conference have put a lot of effort into the organization, it’s only fair play to promote their brand by doing so. Plus, they generally provide logos, so it’s a no-brainer.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your cover slide will spend a little time on screen while you get set up and your audience gets settled. For that reason, you should probably include the title of your talk (that way people will know they’re in the right place), your name, and the name or logo of the conference you’re speaking at. If the talk is being recorded this is especially important as it will serve to introduce future online viewers as well.</p>\n<p>Your last slide should probably include contact information (if you want to provide it) and a link to your slides or notes so that anyone who wants more detail can go find it. This last slide will probably be up for Q&#x26;A and until the next speaker is ready to take the stage.</p>\n<h3>4. Humor</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Keep politics and religion out of your sessions. Also, avoid sexualized imagery, and try not to be an asshole about other people to make a point.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Uk7Zl4m.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>While you want to be an entertaining speaker, you were not invited to this conference as a standup comedian. Making a programming joke or two during a technical talk is probably okay, but anything that could be considered “dark”, “edgy”, or “controversial” should probably not be included.</p>\n<p>If you are unsure, practice your jokes with a trusted friend or colleague first. Everyone likes a funny speaker, but you don’t want to be remembered as the speaker who offended half the room by going too far.</p>\n<h3>5. Practice</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stand up and practice out loud. If you screw something up, do not stop. You won’t get to repeat the whole talk on stage so having those prep sessions at home will make you well prepared for any mishap that might happen on stage.\n<em><a href=\"https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp\">Tomasz Łakomy</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve met a few speakers who know their subject matter so well that they don’t really practice anymore, but this is rare. Almost all of the best speakers I’ve talked with practice a lot, especially with a new talk. I typically run through my talk at least 25 times before I give it on stage at a conference.</p>\n<p>At the same time, you don’t want to sound robotic, so don’t memorize a speech word-for-word. Instead, work of bullet points or notes to give you a good idea of which stories and information come at what times. The only things you might want to rehearse to the point of memorization are your opening line, your closing line, and key transition points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Local user group meetups are always looking for speakers so if you approach them you will rarely hear a, ‘no.’\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-geshan-manandhar/\">Geshan Manandhar</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Practicing alone in front of a mirror is step 1, but most speakers recommend also getting some practice in front of a real group of people. Invite a few of your coworkers to a lunch-and-learn or submit your talk to a Meetup group. As the organizer of a Meetup in Chicago, I can tell you that we always like getting talks submitted by the community.</p>\n<h3>6. Smile and look like you’re having fun</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Enjoy being on the stage and sharing your learnings and experience. Smile! Tell a joke. Be human, and you’ll notice the audience respond to you.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, as you practice the transitions and mechanics of your talk, remember to smile and convey enthusiasm. Even if you’re actually a nervous wreck underneath, people in the audience can rarely tell if you put on a brave face. Faking enthusiasm and calm usually helps keep you that way, so it’s okay if this doesn’t feel natural at first.</p>\n<p>Creating a presentation for a conference talk is a never-ending job. You’ll probably refine your talks each time you give them, customize them based on the time slot and audience, and learn new things to add every year. As you do, keep in mind the presentation tips above.</p>\n<p>Now that you’ve started preparing your presentation, it’s time to get ready for the conference itself. In the next section, we’ll talk about the pre-conference and pre-talk logistics and best practices you should know about as a new speaker.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../success-rejection/\">Previous: Dealing with Success or Rejection</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../pre-conference/\">Next: Preparing for the Conference</a></p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Preparing a Conference Presentation","path":"/guides/speaking/presentation/","category":"Guides","tags":null,"date":null,"image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11nJ2Hnc3CkmrU97ZV83nP0SB0EV80s_K"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>As the day of your conference talk gets closer, there are some logistical considerations that many new speakers probably wouldn’t think about.

Get permission from your employer</h3>\n<p>Not every employer is as generous about speaking. Some will make you take personal days when you go to a conference, and others will make you show your presentation to the PR or legal department first to ensure you aren’t saying anything untoward. On the other hand, some companies will be thrilled that you’re representing them as a speaker and giving them a little free visibility in the community.</p>\n<p>Either way, address it early and figure out what you need to do to get their compliance.</p>\n<h3>2. Double-check the dates with the organizers</h3>\n<p>Organizing a conference is hard work, and sometimes things have to change for unforeseen reasons. While rare, it’s possible that your session could be cut, the conference may have to change its start date or location, or it may get canceled entirely.</p>\n<p>Before you spend any money or take time off work, double-check with the organizers. They also may have a special process for you to go through in order to qualify for reimbursement.</p>\n<h3>3. Book flights and hotel rooms</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve touched base with the organizers, you can go ahead and book any flights or hotel rooms. If you haven’t already, now is the time to lock in who will be paying for the trip: the conference, your employer, or you personally.</p>\n<p>In my experience, less than half of the tech conferences listed on CFP Land cover travel and hotel costs for speakers (if you want to be sure they do, you can use the <a href=\"/conferences/\">filters on CFP Land</a> to check before you apply).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reach an agreement with the organizers on what level of reimbursement they’ll provide before you accept their offer. This is more important with international travel.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another common consideration is combining your conference talk with a personal vacation. For example, I’m speaking at a conference in Minneapolis this summer, but I’m going to bring my family along and stay a few extra days to see the city. If you’d like to do something similar, make sure you clear it with whoever is funding the trip, and try to schedule the vacation time <em>after</em> your talk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you’re going to combine the conference trip with vacation, I highly recommend doing the vacation after the conference, so you’re not stressed about your talk the whole time.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Gather necessary legal documentation</h3>\n<p>This only applies in certain circumstances, but it’s possible when speaking internationally that you’ll need a passport, tax documents, or even a visa. Talk to the organizers as they’ll likely be fielding similar questions from other speakers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2LscPp7.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>5. Get details on the speaker’s dinner</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I really enjoy all the people I’ve been able to meet as a result of the speaking that I’ve done. I especially enjoy chatting with people at the speaker dinners or other informal events surrounding the conference.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like Keanan, I’ve found speaker dinners to be one of the most valuable networking times at a conference. If the conference isn’t having one, ask the organizers if they are offering a Slack channel specifically for speakers or some other informal networking event for speakers. Take full advantage of these and plan to attend if at all possible.</p>\n<h3>6. Practice your presentation</h3>\n<p>While this is covered in more detail in the <a href=\"../presentation/\">section dedicated to creating your presentation</a>, it bears repeating. Plan time to practice your talk. You may make tweaks up until the week before, but at some point, you’ll have to lock it down and practice. Work out your timings, and make sure it fits within the time slot given.</p>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>1-2 Weeks Before the Conference</h2>\n<h3>1. Read over the conference website and speaker materials</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most conference organizers will create a speaker brief or handbook to convey all the key information to you about the event. They’ll cover things like who the audience is, the overall event theme, and the agreed title and content of your talk.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By this time, it’s been months since you applied and accepted your invitation, so it will be helpful to reorient yourself to the conference. This also prevents you from asking the organizers any questions that are already answered elsewhere as they’re probably very busy making final preparations for the event.</p>\n<h3>2. Figure out “last mile” transportation</h3>\n<p>At this point, you should figure out how you’ll get from the airport or train station to your hotel, and finally to the event itself. Well-prepared organizers may sort this out for you and send you instructions (I even spoke at one conference that had limousines pick us up from the airport individually!), but if not, you should look into it. A cab may be expensive, so you might want to find public transportation options, or your hotel might offer shuttle pickup and dropoff.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the conference might not be in the same building as your hotel. If you have to commute, find out if other speakers or attendees are as well, and try to coordinate with them.</p>\n<h3>3. Review the conference schedule</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try to see as many other talks as I can, though that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You should figure out where your talk fits into the conference schedule, and make note of any other talks you’d like to attend. I started off looking for content that sounded interesting, but now I actually look for speakers who I think would be good to meet and talk with and focus on going to those talks instead.</p>\n<p>You should also be aware of the timing of your talk in the day, and the other sessions that are going on at the same time. I find audiences most attentive early on, so I work a little harder to make my talks interactive if they’re just before closing or right after lunch.</p>\n<h3>4. Do you look the part?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you take to the stage, your audience will examine every detail the way they examine a painting — as if it’s there to signify something. For better or worse, clothes serve as visual symbols, so it’s worth thinking about what your clothes are saying as the latest sentence in humanity’s very long visual conversation.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67\">Cassie Kozyrkov</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JQ0ZiSk.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>Speaking at tech conferences doesn’t mean you have to dress formally, but you should dress appropriately for the venue, audience, and content. At this point, you should make sure you’ve got a couple of good outfits to pick from and schedule a last-minute haircut (if needed).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you should be comfortable on stage, but that doesn’t just mean wearing a grey sweatsuit. “Comfortable” means wearing something that gives you confidence and reflects your personal brand.</p>\n<h3>5. Figure out what kind of equipment will be available</h3>\n<p>I talked more about <a href=\"../presentation/\">equipment preparation in the previous section</a>, but at this point, you should double-check with the organizers to see what is available. Will they have a microphone? What kind will it be? Will you be using your laptop or a shared one? Will your power cord work there? What adapters will be available?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Display is not the only point to take into account. If you’re traveling in other countries, power plugs need to be taken care of as well. European countries are mostly compatible with one another, but watch out if you come to Northern America or UK.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Will there be wifi on stage? How fast will it be? (always prepare for it to be slower than you think)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your presentation requires network access, it’s your responsibility to make sure the Wifi will be good enough on-site. For that, I usually ask if there will be a Wifi network dedicated for speakers: I don’t have confidence in a shared one.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You shouldn’t <em>have</em> to bring anything besides your laptop or presentation aids, but it’s worth asking just to be sure.</p>\n<h3>6. Mentally prepare, and keep practicing</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/\">Mike Miles</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While some experienced speakers can deliver a high-quality presentation on the fly, most recommend practicing your talk. If you can give your talk to a real audience (like at a meetup or work event) you’ll feel more confident when the conference comes, but even just practicing alone in front of a mirror can help.</p>\n<h2>When You Arrive at the Conference</h2>\n<h3>1. Scout out your room</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You should also figure out what room you’ll be speaking in — are you in the keynote slot, or in a tiny side-room? Will your talk be recorded? Some conferences only record certain tracks.\n<em><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0\">Nick Heiner</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As early as possible, you should take a look at the room you’ll be presenting in. By this point, the schedule should be finalized, so you will be able to see exactly when and where you’ll give your talk. I typically try to watch a couple talks in the room before my own so I know what it feels like as an audience member there as well.</p>\n<h3>2. Test out any media</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have any kind of interactivity or rich media in your presentation, you absolutely have to run through it with the organizer onsite before you go on stage.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/\">Mark Walker</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you just need slides, this should be quick, but if you’re trying any video or live coding in your presentation, you really need to make sure the equipment available will work as soon as you arrive.</p>\n<p>Even if you asked before, there’s no substitute for knowing it works in person.</p>\n<h3>3. Follow the conference Twitter hashtag or Slack group</h3>\n<p>Finally, as you prepare to speak, it’s a good idea to plug into the audience’s conversation. Most conferences will provide an official “hashtag” on Twitter, but many also have Slack groups as well.</p>\n<p>After your presentation, you may want to check out the stream to see what the audience says about your talk.</p>\n<h2>The Hours Leading Up To Your Session</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won something: pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few “Hell yeah!“s if I think the toilet is empty…it calms my nerves enough so I don’t shake as I speak.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/\">Alex Lakatos</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every speaker’s pre-talk routine is different, but for many of them, having a consistent, confidence-boosting routine is helpful. There are a few things you can try as you develop a pre-talk routine:</p>\n<h3>1. Work out or walk around</h3>\n<p>I always work out or run on the morning of my conference talks. <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/how-working-out-makes-you-more-confident-from-the-inside-out-according-to-science-8565734\">Working out helps boost my confidence</a>, but even just walking around a little helps stimulate blood flow and make you feel better.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7p8WBZD.jpg\"></p>\n<h3>2. Arrive early</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I try to arrive in the room as early as I can after the previous speaker, and normally I run the talk through without notes while getting ready that morning.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laurie-barth/\">Laurie Barth</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Organizers appreciate it when you are in the room before your talk is scheduled to begin. Try to come in at least halfway through the previous speaker’s talk so you can get set up as soon as they’re finished.</p>\n<h3>3. Talk to people</h3>\n<p>For me, talking builds momentum. If I spend a few minutes on the day of my talk conversing with fellow attendees and speakers, I feel much better about getting on stage. I’m not sure if there’s any scientific basis for this, but it works for me.</p>\n<h3>4. Sit in a quiet room</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, I’ve met speakers who go into a dark, quiet room up until the moment they get on stage. There’s nothing wrong with this method either, so you’ll just have to figure out what works for you.</p>\n<h3>5. Listen to a pump-up playlist</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another common preparation technique is listening to music. Generally listening to upbeat music can make you feel more confident and care-free, so it makes sense that this appeals to many speakers.</p>\n<p>Going into a conference prepared is one of the best ways to ensure your success as a speaker.

Be sure your topic is something you really want to speak, answer questions, and learn everything you possibly can about.</p>\n<p>Here are some things to consider when choosing a topic:</p>\n<h3>1. Does it fit the conference?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think carefully about what your audience is interested in as opposed to what you are. What problems do they want to solve? What are the gaps in their experience? Where do they need guidance? You need to serve a need and purpose, and if you can map your presentation more commonly to these needs, you are more likely to get picked.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Matching your talk with the conference’s area of focus is one of the best ways to get more talks accepted. Not only should the talk fit the conference’s broad area, but you should also look at the individual “tracks” the conference will be offering and make sure your abstract fits into one of them.</p>\n<p>For example, you’re never going to get a PHP-focused talk accepted at a Python conference, but if you have a Javascript talk, you might find lots of conferences with a “frontend” track that is appropriate for your topic.</p>\n<h3>2. Does it get you excited?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DO NOT propose a topic that you think will get you on stage but doesn’t actually excite you at all.\n<em><a href=\"https://rckbt.me/2014/01/conference-proposals/\">Raquel Vélez</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the hardest things you will ever have to do as a speaker is stand up on stage for an hour talking about something you’re not really interested in. That’s why you need to pick a topic that gets you excited, but keep in mind that your interests will change over time. Sometimes a topic you cared about 2 years ago will no stop be interesting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pick a topic that you wouldn’t mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your interest level and passion for the topic will come across in your presentation. It’s really hard to fake genuine excitement, and having that positive energy will make you a much more confident and effective speaker. Audiences want to listen to speakers who are excited about their topic, and conference committees will notice that in your application.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present. It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-drishti-jain/\">Drishti Jain</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, talks that get you excited are easy to prepare for. You probably choose to spend time learning about the topic already, so channeling that knowledge into a talk you can share with others is just the logical next step.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You know you’re passionate about a topic if you’re already spending a lot of time reading about it, thinking about it, and debating it with people on Twitter. Wrap your talks around your passions.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/\">Anjuan Simmons</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Is it something you know well?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgeable about. Don’t experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just being excited about a topic isn’t enough on its own. You also have to be (or become) very knowledgeable about it. While you may have lots of time to learn about the topic between when your talk gets accepted and when you first present it, don’t underestimate the amount of time it takes to prepare a really strong conference presentation.</p>\n<p>New speakers may want to stick to topic areas they know already to minimize the amount of after-hours work they have to put in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think of something you’ve been successful at professionally, and then think of what advice you’d give to others on that topic. Can you come up with 5–10 tips to make your audience better at X? A coding language, a new tool, even a soft skill? Then you’ve got enough to respond to a CFP.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/\">Laura Janusek</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Using things you’ve learned at work or on a side project are usually a good direction. If you collaborated with others, you can also get their thoughts on the topic and integrate that into your talk as well.</p>\n<h3>4. Is it sufficiently unique?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talks that can be summarized as an ‘Intro to (Tool)’ are often lazily conceived, poorly designed, and delivered mechanically. Great talks, meanwhile, dive deeper and are eager to explore fundamental issues, even if they use a tool as the catalyst for discussion.\n<em><a href=\"http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks\">Justin Searls</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best conferences are looking for speakers who can do really unique and deep dives into a topic. Surface-level “intro to X” talks aren’t likely to get accepted at the most competitive international events. Speakers are expected to present unique, novel, experimental, and personal talks at these kinds of events.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s fairly easy for anyone to step in, read available materials and prepare a mediocre presentation. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve done it too, which now makes me able to see why we can do better. Trust me, we’ve all seen the Angular 2 talks already. Don’t copy your predecessors. Interesting angle on React Native? Experimental usage of Rails to build a realtime app? Your own personal experiences and unexpected solutions? Yes, please.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That said, smaller regional conferences might be interested in simple, “how-to” talks. Some of my most highly accepted talks are introductory-level talks on Docker and Testing because lots of attendees are actually interested in learning about those topics, and can use them as a reason to get their companies to send them to the conference.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ANY topic is fair game even if people have talked about it before. You can always bring a new perspective to a topic.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-molly-struve/\">Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you should try to make your talk unique, you don’t <em>have</em> to be the only person in the world giving talks on a particular topic to get accepted to speak about it.</p>\n<h3>5. Does it make the world a better place?</h3>\n<p>One of the things that <a href=\"../why-speak/\">motivates many speakers</a> is a desire to improve the world around them, and this comes across in their choice of topics. Even technical topics can make the world a better place because they’re spreading knowledge that you have to others.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talk about topics that make the world a better place; in particular accessibility, diversity, ethics, etc. I [try] to go beyond just technical issues and spread good ideas I believe in.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd\">Oleksandr Tryshchenko</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Try to think about how your talk will improve the audience members’ lives. If you can convey that in the talk description or abstract, you’ll make a big impression on the organizing committee.</p>\n<h3>6. Is it genuine?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Submit sessions that are interesting, engaging, and challenging, but don’t resort to clickbait titles and topics. Break the mold of what people normally talk about and how they discuss it, but stay classy.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/\">Jono Bacon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some speakers are tempted to take speaking as an opportunity to push the limits of what can be said on stage. This might work, but it’s a risky tactic for a new conference speaker. Selection committees can see through cheap laughs and hackneyed titles, so keep your topics clear and intentions genuine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The talks that are most engaging to me include stories of failure, they talk about learning something you don’t know and falling down along the way, or they’re a new perspective from an outsider on a specific topic.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laurie-barth/\">Laurie Barth</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being genuine can also mean sharing a story about how you failed in the past. This is a great topic because nobody succeeds every time they attempt something, so your audience will probably resonate with the description of challenges you’ve failed to reach.</p>\n<h3>7. Is it actionable?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talking about why technology X is cool in a general way can be just fine, but sharing how we used X at Y to achieve Z gives the audience something more concrete to walk away with.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/\">George Mandis</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thinking about topics that are actually useful to your audience is surprisingly hard. A lot of new technology is interesting but practically useless, so try to center around real problems that can be solved by your area of focus.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OK talks are about the topic. Good talks are about the speaker/presentation. Great talks are about the audience.\n<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344\">Kyle Simpson</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another way of thinking about this is by thinking about your audience and what they hope to take away from your talk. Keeping your takeaways succinct and clear will help you in this effort. Your slides shouldn’t be bullet points, but there’s no reason your abstract shouldn’t use a list of key learnings for readers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your talk should have a point. When someone walks away from your talk they might only take away 2-3 things with them. Those things should be in your proposal\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"card bg-info-light mb-3\">\n<div class=\"card-body\">\n  <h5 class=\"card-title\">\n    <strong>Like this guide?</strong><br/>\n    Subscribe to get advice, interviews with conference speakers, and new speaking opportunities in your inbox every week!\n  </h5>\n  <form\n    class=\"row\"\n    action=\"https://cfpland.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4eba8b205fc13380cd3e6f3fc&amp;id=258f553f4e\"\n    method=\"post\"\n  >\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8\">\n      <input\n        name=\"EMAIL\"\n        type=\"email\"\n        class=\"form-control mb-2\"\n        id=\"emailInput\"\n        aria-label=\"Enter email to get CFPs in your inbox every week\"\n        placeholder=\"Enter email\"\n        required\n      />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-3\">\n      <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-secondary btn-block mb-2\">\n        Sign Up\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Writing a Title and Abstract</h2>\n<p>Now that you have some tips for picking a topic, you can write a talk title and abstract. Each CFP you submit to will require a title and abstract and the organizing committee’s selection will be largely based on these fields, so it’s important to spend time on them.</p>\n<p>Here are some tips for writing a great abstract and title to submit to conference calls for proposals:</p>\n<h3>1. Customize each submission</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At least 30% of ~2,500 proposals I’ve ever read violated the predefined rules for talk abstracts and submissions that have been set…no matter how adept in speaking you are, do read the instructions carefully before submitting and ensure the proposal is following them.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every conference has its own set of priorities, rules, and requests for abstracts. Be sure to read everything they include on their CFP page as well as their conference website.</p>\n<p>In addition to the clearly-stated rules, every conference attracts a slightly different audience, and as a speaker, you should know who is in that audience before you submit your abstract. Even if the bulk of your talk will be the same at each conference, the abstract may need to be revisited between each one.</p>\n<h3>2. Include enticing details</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make it easy for a reviewer to get excited about your talk. Be specific and get into the details about what you’re point of view is.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260\">Maggi Mitchell</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vague abstracts or titles are not easy to assess. Conference attendees won’t go to a talk they don’t understand, so it’s best to be clear and include an appropriate amount of detail in each abstract you submit. This means including tangible details that show the organizers and attendees that you know what you’re talking about as well as some concrete takeaways they can expect to glean from your talk.</p>\n<h3>3. Don’t be too wordy</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most of JSConfs receive an average of 500 proposals, assuming a very strict 1-minute reading time per submission it’s still a full workday of reading…A good rule of thumb is two to three paragraphs clearly expressing your idea.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Depending on the rules the conference lays out, between 200 and 500 words is usually allowed, so you have to include details while being succinct. It’s not easy, but when you consider that some conferences receive hundreds of submissions, it’s easy to see why it’s necessary.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that your audience might be reading your abstract on a small, printed handout, so be informative without boring them with jargon or unnecessary detail.</p>\n<h3>4. Get a proofreader</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A typical conference selection team will be reading dozens or hundreds of session proposals…That means conference organizers are going to skim…many if not most will automatically discount anything with obvious typographical and grammar mistakes.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">Larry Garfield</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think of your abstract like you would your resume when applying for jobs. Details matter. Spelling and grammar mistakes will hurt your credibility and make you look sloppy to organizers who are already looking for any excuse to lighten their submission load.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jM4NxQD.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This reason alone is probably enough to get a proofreader, but having other people read your proposal can also help make sure you aren’t relying too heavily on jargon or assuming too much about what your reader knows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts — I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/\">Rhia Dixon</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stepping back and being your own proofreader can help as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don’t immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-matthew-trask/\">Matthew Trask</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An English teacher once told me to go back and read my papers one word at a time starting at the end. This forces you to think about each word and can help you fix simple spelling mistakes. Tools like Grammarly can help with these fundamentals as well.</p>\n<h3>5. Avoid cliches</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don’t use cliches, everyone uses cliches and it makes your proposal blend in. If you feel the pull of using a phrase everyone has heard “a million times”, ask yourself if it adds to what you’re trying to convey.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cliches are very tricky to use well without seeming trite. In general, conference speakers should avoid using them in their titles or abstracts. If you need some good examples of cliches, <a href=\"https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-cliches.html\">here’s a list</a>.</p>\n<h3>6. Find a format that works for your talk</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There’s no one right way to write a session pitch, but I’ve found the 3-part pitch works well for me. A 3-part pitch has three key points, in order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>State the problem</li>\n<li>Tease the solution</li>\n<li>Explain how you’ll provide the rest of the solution in the session</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">Larry Garfield</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not every speaker takes an approach that’s as prescribed as Larry’s above, but it might be a good idea to start with a very formulaic method of writing and submitting talks until you get more comfortable with the process. This can help you focus on the content and mechanics before moving on to creative approaches.</p>\n<h3>7. Get creative</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conferences are generally looking for novelty when choosing talks.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260\">Maggi Mitchell</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because you’re trying to stand out, there is some room to break the mold. While having a format for your talk submission might help, don’t feel like you can’t try something a little different from time to time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing I found helps in my abstract creative process, is to make word clouds. Given a topic like “security” or “performance” I write down as many other words come to mind. I then stack rank them based on which are the most interesting. I write about 10-20 different intro sentences. About 3-4 different copies of the “takeaway” sentences, and about 5-10 outro sentences. I then mix them up until they feel right.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Look into <a href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/articles/top-brainstorming-techniques--cms-27181\">brainstorming methods</a> if you have trouble coming up with creative new ideas or topics. Sometimes these will unlock things that will set your talk apart from other similar submissions.</p>\n<h3>8. Aim for a specific experience level</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn the approximate proficiency of your target audience before giving a talk. Make it easier or harder if needed. I mismatched several times, and it’s not the best thing to do.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd\">Oleksandr Tryshchenko</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Generally, conferences are looking for a wide range of talks directed at different experience levels. When you write your abstract, be sure to make it clear if your talk is especially directed at beginners, intermediate, or advanced learners. This will help the conference organizers know where to slot your talk in and help attendees decide whether your talk is right for them or not.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a conference was only filled with super-advanced talks, they would lose a huge part of their audience. So, even if you just learned something, you can teach it and many attendees will welcome your perspective as a relatively-recent beginner. Since you just went through it all for the first time yourself, you know and remember all the roadblocks that someone getting started will have and can help them learn even quicker.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>9. Use inclusive, positive language</h3>\n<p>Technology conferences have become <a href=\"https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/diversity-in-conference-speakers\">very aware of the lack of diversity and inclusion</a> in our industry, and many are actively trying to reverse it. Even if the conference isn’t addressing these issues directly, using words and phrases that may offend in your abstract is a really bad idea. It alienates users from your otherwise good content and makes you seem less credible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conference track chair here: please don’t curse or use any offensive language in your session title. It’s not cute, it violates the code of conduct, you were told not to in the CFP, and I will automatically rate your submission a zero.\n<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aburke626/status/1205566597563404288\">Alanna Burke</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, be aware of ableist language. You might think using the word “crazy” is just a way to describe illogical technology choices, but you could also be hurting people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Common examples of ableist language are words like, “lame,” “dumb,” “retarded,” “blind,” “deaf,” “idiot,” “imbecile,’ “nuts,” “psycho,” and “spaz.” These terms can be associated with a person’s identity or their challenges, and because of that, can be interpreted as insulting or hurtful.\n<em><a href=\"https://deareverybody.hollandbloorview.ca/learn/tips-and-tools/how-to-avoid-using-ableist-language/#.XcXTqJJKigQ\">Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>10. Take time with the title</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A good title is reasonably short, self-descriptive, contains the appropriate buzzwords for your topic (and no others), and has enough of a “hook” to make someone want to read further (or attend).\n<em><a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">Larry Garfield</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While your abstract may be a few hundred words, your title will probably only be 10 or 20, so it’s really hard to make it convey meaning while being interesting to readers. This is why you should spend a good amount of time thinking about and refining your title.</p>\n<p>This is another area where brainstorming techniques and coming back to it later can help.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Set a timer for 3 minutes, write as many titles as you can. Pick your favorite, then write the rest of your submission. When you’re done go back and throw away the title and re-write it.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>11. Close strong</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make the last sentence in your abstract somewhat memorable, preferably short, even better if it’s actionable.\n<em><a href=\"https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal\">Richard Schneeman</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last sentence in your abstract is your hook. It’s that final word that reels readers in and makes them want more or inspires them. It matters.</p>\n<h2>Submitting Your Talks</h2>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rtdrFXw.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>Once you’ve picked a topic and written an abstract and title for your talk, you’re about almost done, but there are a few more things you should consider before you click the final “Submit” button:</p>\n<h3>1. You may be asked to submit more information</h3>\n<p>The organizing committee will select talks based primarily on the abstract and title fields, but they may also have you submit other information like a long description or your qualifications. These fields vary pretty widely, but since the audience is only internal conference organizers, you don’t have to worry quite as much about it being catchy. Shoot for informative, include lots of links to references, and videos of you speaking if possible. Conference organizers want to know that you can stand in front of a crowd.</p>\n<h3>2. Plan to submit multiple talks to each conference</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No matter how confident you are, never bet the farm on one idea — brainstorm and prepare several talks.\n<em><a href=\"https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32\">Karolina Szczur</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most conferences will encourage you to submit more than one talk, and some may have an upper limit on the number of talks you can submit. Either way, it will not hurt you to submit multiple abstracts. In fact, many conferences want speakers who can give multiple talks because it cuts down on the amount of funding and coordination they have to spend working with speakers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing that started really getting me more speaking opportunities is submitting multiple talks to each CFP. Conference organizers sometimes have an agenda of the talks they’re looking to accept and if you submit more talks, you give them more chances to fit you into the schedule they’re looking to craft.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/\">Keanan Koppenhaver</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Consider a workshop</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Workshops require a lot of preparation time that not every speaker has. You can improve your chances of being accepted by submitting such a workshop.\n<em><a href=\"https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/\">Nicolas Fränkel</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Conferences that offer workshops often struggle to find good speakers to give these 4-8 hour interactive sessions. You might be more likely to get your talk accepted if you offer it as a workshop. Keep in mind that workshops are completely different from typical conference talks though. The first time I gave a conference workshop, it took me about 20 hours of work to convert my slides into an interactive format for attendees.</p>\n<h3>4. Be persistent</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If getting a talk proposal accepted seems like an unattainable goal, just keep sending in proposals and you’ll probably eventually get something accepted.\n<em><a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jason-swett/\">Jason Swett</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the next section, we’ll talk more about dealing with success and rejection, but ultimately you have to be persistent if you want to become a conference speaker. Most speakers I talk to have an acceptance rate of around 10%-20%, so expect to submit at least 5-10 before you get a talk accepted.</p>\n<p>Keep trying, and if you’re ready to learn more, keep reading to learn what happens when your talk is accepted or rejected from a conference.</p>\n<p><a class=\"text-left d-block\" href=\"../finding-cfps/\">Previous: Finding and Selecting CFPs</a>\n<a class=\"text-right d-block\" href=\"../success-rejection/\">Next: What Comes Next?

After gathering feedback from hundreds of technology conference speakers, I realized that like me, many of them struggled to find and keep up with which CFPs were available and which ones they had applied to. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to make sure CFP Land was self-sustaining, so CFP Land Pro was born.</p>\n<p>If you’re considering a <a href=\"/members/\">Pro Membership</a>, read on to learn more about everything that’s included. Don’t hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:info@cfpland.com\">email me</a> if you have questions about how CFP Land can help you be a more successful speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2><span id=\"early-access\">1. Early Access to CFPs</span></h2>\n<p>The weekly CFP Land newsletter and <a href=\"/conferences/\">our free conference listings</a> show all CFPs that close in the next 21 days. Usually this is plenty of time to apply, but many conferences review applicants on a rolling basis. In those cases, <strong>applying as early as possible is advantageous</strong>.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular features among Pro Members is the early access to CFPs. If you’re not a Pro Member already, you won’t see any conferences tagged <code class=\"language-text\">⬆️ Pro</code> in your feed, but if you sign up for a Pro Membership, here’s what it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png\" alt=\"Pro Members get access to CFPs 21 days before free members\"></a></p>\n<p>As a Pro Member, you can see all the CFPs in our database that are closing in the next <strong>42 days</strong>, meaning you’ll be able to apply much earlier than free users.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"save-cfps\">2. Save CFPs</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/save-cfps-1.gif\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Save conferences to be reminded before they close\"></a></p>\n<p>It’s easy to lose track of which CFPs you want to submit when there are hundreds each month on CFP Land alone. <strong>Saving CFPs is a great way to keep up with the conferences that you care about most.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you save a CFP to your Pro account, you’ll get email reminders 21, 7, and 3 days before it closes. This is great if you’re browsing CFPs on mobile, but you don’t want to forget to submit to them when you’re back at your computer.</p>\n<p>Another useful reason to save CFPs is to personalize your feed of upcoming Calls for Proposals. By default, there may be 50 to 100 open CFPs on the “All” page, so saving CFPs will ensure you don’t have to wade through quite as many irrelevant conferences.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"export-cfps\">3. Export CFPs to Your Personal Calendar</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/export-cfps-2.gif\" alt=\"Using CFP Land Pro to export conferences to your calendar\"></a></p>\n<p>You don’t have to track your CFPs in CFP Land. Pro Members also get a calendar export tool that allows you to save CFPs to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook.</p>\n<p>This is helpful if you want to create custom reminders or use your own calendar notifications rather than the CFP Land emails.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"search-alerts\">4. Custom Search Alerts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-2.gif\" alt=\"Saving searches with your CFP Land Pro Membership\"></a></p>\n<p>All CFP Land users can use filters to search for conferences that match their preferences, but if you’re a free user, you will need to check the site periodically to make sure you don’t miss any new opportunities. In order to make your life a little easier, <strong>CFP Land Pro Members can save their searches to get an email alert when new CFPs are found that match their filters.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/saved-search-3.png\" class=\"right\" alt=\"Email alert when results from a saved search are found\" /></a></p>\n<p>When a new conference CFP is found that matches one of your saved searches, you’ll get an email about it, letting you know that you can either <a href=\"/blog/pro-saving-cfps/\">Save the CFP</a> or apply right away.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you’ll never miss another great CFP once you set up your searches on <a href=\"/members/\">CFP Land Pro</a>.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"abstracts\">5. Save Your Abstracts</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/abstracts.png\" alt=\"Abstracts on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Most experienced speakers have a pool of abstracts that they could submit depending on the audience and conference focus. CFP Land Pro Members can save those Abstracts to their CFP Land account so that they can tie them to each CFP they submit.</p>\n<p>This is a great way to see which of your abstracts is the most successful and to remember which Abstract you submitted to which conference.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"track\">6. Track Your Submissions</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/members/\"><img src=\"/img/posts/track.gif\" alt=\"Track submissions on CFP Land Pro\"></a></p>\n<p>Finally, if you submit dozens of Abstracts per year, it can be hard to keep up with all of them. In my first year of speaking, I used a giant spreadsheet to track over 50 submissions, and it got to be a huge mess.</p>\n<p>CFP Land Pro Members can track the conferences they’ve applied to, been accepted at, and been rejected from in addition to attaching their Abstracts to each submission.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Much more will be coming soon, so if you’re interested, <a href=\"/members/\">your CFP Land Pro Membership is just a few clicks away</a>!</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Pro Members Only: A Complete List of All the Features CFP Land Pro Members Get","path":"/blog/pro-features/","category":"Updates","tags":["Pro Features"],"date":"2020/02/07","image":"/img/posts/pro-early-access.png"}}}],"pathPrefix":"content","first":false,"last":false,"index":2,"pageCount":10,"additionalContext":{}}}
