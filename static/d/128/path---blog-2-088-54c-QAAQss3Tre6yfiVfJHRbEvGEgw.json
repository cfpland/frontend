A self-taught developer and technical writer, Tae‚Äôlur has used her gift for breaking down complex topics to inspire and teach other aspiring developers across the world. Just two years ago, she was working at a minimum wage fast-food job, and now she‚Äôs been accepted to speak at 8 tech conferences about topics ranging from her journey to VR development in React. Not many stories out there are as inspiring at Tae‚Äôlur‚Äôs, so read on and hear what she‚Äôs learned along the way.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Y6wxxj3.jpg\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I am a Front-End Engineer and technical content creator. I‚Äôm currently a freelance technical writer and in my current contract position, I‚Äôm writing product documentation &#x26; user guides. I also write tutorials on topics such as Git &#x26; Gatsby.</p>\n<p>My mission is to make the learning curve of software development an easier process for everyone. I got into speaking after I was invited to share my story of how <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaelurAlexis/status/1046663234978115585\">I transitioned into tech from fast food</a> at CascadiaJS in November 2018. A few months later, I decided to just follow accounts like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cfp_land\">@cfpland</a> and submit talks!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like how I‚Äôm putting myself out there and slowly yet surely coming out of my introverted shell. I‚Äôve always had a secret obsession with researching and curating resources so being able to travel and present my findings is my thing. The public speaking is a strategic move, my goal is to get into developer advocacy.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7idBFx7erWA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tae‚Äôlur Alexis, ‚ÄúCreating 3D User Experiences with React‚Äù at React 360</em></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first solo conference talk was just recently actually! It occurred June 6, 2019. It was RefactrTech, a conference based in Atlanta and the presentation was titled, ‚ÄúBuilding Accessible UI with React‚Äù. The talk consisted of me discussing ways you can improve the accessibility of your application and the different libraries and tools you can use.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to at least 15, have been accepted to 8 and have spoken at one so far.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My process has so far been to gather so many resources on the topic I‚Äôm presenting on and read through the documentation and possibly experiment with building demos. Building demos can really help you with learning the ins and outs on a topic and you never know what you may uncover.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Advice I‚Äôd give to new speakers before they give a talk is to remember these are regular people who are rooting for you. And the biggest step is to just be there. And when it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over. Afterwards you‚Äôre free to roam, explore and breathe.</p>\n<p>You don‚Äôt need to be an expert, just be passionately curious. Follow @cfp_land, have an interesting talk title and abstract (summary of what your talk would be on) and just submit to every conference that‚Äôs relevant to your interests. You can submit multiple talks and I highly encourage you do so. People call this ‚Äúconference-driven development‚Äù. The submissions are reviewed and approved MONTHS before the conference actually happens so you‚Äôll have time.</p>\n<p>Another way to find conferences that‚Äôs worked for me is to literally search ‚Äútech cfp‚Äù on Twitter!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/eveporcello\">Eve Porcello</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a> are my top inspirations.</p>\n<p>CascadiaJS was the first conference I‚Äôve ever attended and as stated, it occurred in November 2018. Eve Porcello invited me to her GraphQL workshop at CascadiaJS in Seattle and seeing how comfortable she was presenting on such an advanced topic was so inspiring. And then to know she‚Äôs authored O‚ÄôReilly books and travels doing conference talks and workshops for a living BLEW. MY. MIND.</p>\n<p>Then I meet Marcy Sutton who embraced me after I spoke on stage about my story. Her passion around accessibility and learning more about her role in developer advocacy is literally why I do what I do today. They are both the reason why I‚Äôve pursued accessibility and developer advocacy. I want to be able to use my interest in writing and community engagement to make an impact and have a nomadic career.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/TaelurAlexis\">follow me on Twitter</a> and I post weekend recaps on what I have going on in my life <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TaelurAlexis\">on YouTube here</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm building an online platform called <a href=\"https://codeeveryday.io/\">CodeEveryday</a> where I‚Äôm providing learning resources, mentorship and job postings so you can subscribe to the newsletter as we prep for the release!

It‚Äôs easy when you\nspend every day working with caching in Ruby, for example, to forget that most devs never get the chance to do what you do.\nLike Molly, many speakers realize that their unique knowledge is worth sharing, and start getting on stage. In this interview,\nwe talked about Molly‚Äôs journey and some of her advice for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sU57xj3.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I am currently the Lead Site Reliability Engineer at Kenna Security. I have been working at Kenna for almost 4 years now and I got into public speaking last year thanks to the support at Kenna.</p>\n<p>My lead at the time suggested that I find ways I could share my knowledge with others. I had become extremely proficient and knowledge about making performance improvements in our Ruby application so I started with sharing that knowledge internally and then decided to try submitting a talk on it to a conference. I submitted a proposal to RubyConf not thinking anything would come of it. Because my expectations were low I also submitted a talk to a local meetup about another technical passion of mine, Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, BOTH talks were accepted and my Fall quickly became very busy. I had done debate and was good at speaking in high school, but I was not sure what to expect from technical speaking. After giving my first talk and seeing the response it got and how thankful the people were, I was hooked! It has been less than a year since that first talk and I have given 2 conference talks since, plus a few Meetup talks.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I enjoy being able to share my advice with a lot of people at once. It is like mentoring or giving advice on steroids. I also really enjoy getting out of the office and getting to meet other devs. Everyone has such difference experiences and being able to chat with everyone is a great way to bring back new ideas and learn new things.</p>\n<p>It has definitely benefited my career because I have made so many amazing professional connections via speaking. All of my talks were inspired by my work, but are not required for me to do my job. The speaking and additional connections I have made have also benefited Kenna as well in the form of bringing in job candidates. Kenna has been very supportive of all the speaking and covers all of my expenses whenever I speak.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>You bet I do since it was last November! It went fabulous! For a few days after I was on a high from it.</p>\n<p>I have looked up to many speakers and the idea of me being up on the stage was almost something I couldn‚Äôt comprehend. Once I did it, I was amazed with myself and also immediately ready to do it again! My only regret was that I left my necklace on and that interfered with the mic near the end. I was worried that it might have been horrible for those listening, but no one said anything. I don‚Äôt think many people even noticed. Being a perfectionist, I definitely did. But live and learn!</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEi-vYcyTT8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2018-cache-is-king-get-the-most-bang-for-your-buck-from-ruby\">Cache is King: Get the Most Bang for Your Buck From Ruby by Molly Struve</a></em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I have spoken at 3 conferences and applied to probably 9, some of which are this fall so I am waiting to hear back about those. The 3 conferences I have spoken at have all been Ruby conferences which have been incredible! A couple I applied to in the Fall are Site Reliability and DevOps conferences. I am interested, if accepted, to see how they differ.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I am a big proponent of practicing my talk!</p>\n<p>I know some people who prefer not to practice and they do better when they wing it, but I am not one of those people. I like to know exactly what I am going to say when I get up there. Because of that I practice my talk a lot and I memorize my intro and ending so those are guaranteed to go smoothly. Right before I talk I like to <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are?language=en\">Power Pose</a>. But when I Power Pose, I do it with a twist. I recite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zFHkBQBg-4\">these lines from Jr in Cool Runnings</a> All of that helps me feel really confident and bad ass before I go on.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>The best advice I have for new speakers, especially those who feel intimidated by speaking at a conference, is to start small. <strong>Begin by giving talks internally at your company first.</strong> It could be as simple as giving a demo of a feature you built. From there, consider lightening talks at a conference or even a talk at a Meetup. Once you are comfortable, then apply to a conference.</p>\n<p>If you are a new speaker that has already been accepted to give a conference talk then my best advice would be to <strong>give your talk in a smaller setting about a month before</strong>. This forces you to get the talk done early which will save you from last minute, frantic cramming. It will also allow you to get some feedback on the talk. I gave my first conference talk 3 times before RubyConf. I gave it at 2 small meetups and once for my coworkers. Every time I got great feedback that I was able to use to tweak the talk and make it more clear and approachable.</p>\n<p>Picking a topic can also be a struggle for people who want to get started, but sometimes feel they have nothing ‚Äúnew‚Äù to talk about. First and foremost, <strong>ANY topic is fair game even if people have talked about it before</strong>. You can always bring a new perspective to a topic. Even presenting new examples for a topic could help someone who has heard the topic a thousand times finally understand it. My first conference talk I wrote, Cache is King, I thought for sure it was too ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and not ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù enough to ever be considered. But I quickly learned, most conference talks aren‚Äôt about discovering something new, they are about taking a topic and presenting it in a way that is approachable and helps your audience learn something.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek\">Saron Yitbarek</a> has been HUGELY inspirational as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/r00k\">Ben Ornstein</a>.</p>\n<p>Right after I got accepted to speak at my first conference I watched Saron‚Äôs talk on building a community which gave me all the good feels I needed to believe I could take on this daunting task. I then watched Ben Ornstein‚Äôs talk on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JXH7JPjR4\">How to Give a Technical Talk</a> and that really inspired me to make my speech relatable and entertaining. My favorite quote is, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt teach them anything if you don‚Äôt have their attention‚Äù</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I have been pretty good about keeping my personal website up to date and that is <a href=\"https://www.mollystruve.com/\">www.mollystruve.com</a>. There I have links to my Twitter, blog, Instagram, Facebook, etc. I am also very passionate about blogging so I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt include a link directly to my blog, <a href=\"https://dev.to/molly_struve\">dev.to/mollystruve</a>.</p>\n<p>I am a big fan of taking a talk and breaking it down into blog posts so it can reach more people.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm a Lead Designer at 8th Light, a custom software consultancy. I do UX and front-end development and work with various clients on designing and building their software.</p>\n<p>I was never interested in public speaking, but before I became a designer about 3 years ago I worked at an education-focused non-profit, and have a background in teaching, so I‚Äôve always been pretty comfortable in the very small scale stage of a classroom. Before I started at 8th Light I volunteered doing a workshop about domestic violence, and part of my apprenticeship involved doing a talk for a small group of people, and I did that workshop.</p>\n<p>I got a lot of positive feedback, and eventually did a version of it at our internal company conference. A while later, a co-worker who was organizing a Ruby conference asked me to do a short talk about how developers could do quick usability testing, so that they could have good UX of features they were building when there wasn‚Äôt a designer in the room. That talk went pretty well despite the fact that I felt like I was going to pass out the entire time.</p>\n<p>I did that talk at another conference, but quickly felt a strong urge to go back to speaking about something I really cared about. I had been thinking for a long time about the ways that technology enables domestic violence, and had been collecting examples, but never felt like I was an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù enough to do a talk about it. It really seemed like something that other, smarter people were working on. But eventually I realized that wasn‚Äôt true, that if someone out there was already talking about this stuff, I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me find them.</p>\n<p>Right around that time, Russ Unger, who leads UX Camp in Chicago, responded to a proposal I‚Äôd submitted saying my topic wasn‚Äôt quite right, and he asked ‚Äúis there anything else you‚Äôve though about doing a talk about?‚Äù I told him about my idea for a talk about how tech enables domestic violence, and he said that would be perfect for the conference. I owe him a lot for taking the time to figure out that this talk was on my mind and giving me what I needed to finally do it. It took dozens of hours of research and stitching together stories from news articles and people who had disclosed their experiences to me to make my talk, but I finally did it, and ever since UX Camp I‚Äôve had a lot of success with it.</p>\n<h3>What do you focus on speaking about?</h3>\n<p>My speaking is all about how technology enables domestic violence; how abusers can utilize technology to further their power and control over their victims, and how products that don‚Äôt enable abuse but are clearly spaces where survivors are taking certain actions that disclose the abuse and meaningful intervention could be provided (‚ÄúSurvivor‚Äù is the preferred term instead over ‚Äúvictim‚Äù, since it speaks to the person‚Äôs ability to endure and survive a dangerous situation.)</p>\n<p>I tell a story about someone experiencing domestic violence in 5 different areas, give stats that correlate to those areas, and describe ways that more thoughtful design or building of the product could prevent the abuse. The 5 areas are financial abuse through online banking tools, harassment and monitoring through ‚Äúsmart‚Äù home devices/Internet of Things devices, stalking through GPS-enabled devices, personal security through software such as building management software, and how fitness, wellness, and pregnancy products could be a place of meaningful intervention.</p>\n<p>I think it goes without saying that domestic violence is a worthwhile thing to do a talk about, but just in case you need convincing, here are some stats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 in 3 American women will experience severe physical abuse at the hands of an intimate partner.</li>\n<li>For men, that number is 1 in 4. Domestic violence is not an edge case.</li>\n<li>The number one cause of death among pregnant women in America is murder by her current or ex intimate partner.</li>\n<li>3 women are murdered by their current or ex intimate partners in America each week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are real people who are being controlled, beaten, and murdered - and we in tech have a role to play in preventing it from happening.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I don‚Äôt see myself as a ‚Äúpublic speaker‚Äù - I really just want to spread the content of my talk because I think it‚Äôs really important.</p>\n<p>But I‚Äôve learned a few things: <strong>first, as someone who gets a lot of stage fright, the only thing that helps is just doing it a bunch.</strong> After 4 or 5 times talking a stage, it started to get a lot easier. After doing it a bunch and not dying, you start to realize it‚Äôs going to be ok. That‚Äôs the advice I give people who ask about speaking even though they‚Äôre not a natural public speaker - you have to just do it, but then it quickly gets a lot easier.</p>\n<p><strong>The second thing I like about speaking at conferences is that I also get to attend them!</strong> I think I‚Äôve grown in my career more rapidly than average in part because of attending half a dozen conferences in the past few months and learning a ton. My advice is to focus on applying to conferences you‚Äôd actually want to attend, so that they‚Äôre also a learning experience for you. I can only do so many conferences in a year, so I figure I might as well prioritize speaking at ones I also want to attend.</p>\n<p><strong>The third thing I like is that speaking at conferences unexpectedly helped with my social anxiety a lot.</strong> I‚Äôm introverted and socially anxious, but so many days of having strangers come up and talk to me about my talk, and share their experiences with violence, was the intense exposure I needed to start to get past my social anxiety. Within 6 months, I‚Äôve become so much more confident talking to strangers and being in new situations that would have induced a lot of anxiety in the past - all thanks to conference speaking. I really want people to know that you can be introverted, awkward, and socially anxious, and still be a great conference speaker and get a ton of benefit from doing it.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>7 so far, with a few more confirmed for the fall - include StrangeLoop, which I almost didn‚Äôt apply to because it seemed like such a long shot! I‚Äôve applied to about 40, and gotten 10 rejections, with the other 23 still up in the air.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhWPnKg4oK4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Eva PenzeyMoog: Designing Against Domestic Violence</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Deep breathing! And lots of practice, to the point that you don‚Äôt need to rely on speaker notes. It makes such a difference.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>Two things:</p>\n<p><strong>You do NOT need to have the talk written before you write a proposal for that talk to apply to conferences with, and you do NOT need to already be an expert in the field that you‚Äôre proposing a talk about.</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling like you need to know and do so many things before even applying to something you might get rejected from is a surefire way to get overwhelmed and never start. Choose something you‚Äôre legitimately interested in and would want to become an expert in, write the proposal and apply to as many conferences as possible. Once you get accepted to one, then create the talk and learn all about it. You don‚Äôt need to present the answers in your proposal. I wish someone had spelled this out for me earlier on - I would have started applying with this talk a lot sooner!</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie\">Sara Wachter-Boettcher</a> is a huge inspiration. She keeps it real - she‚Äôll call out the chatbot you‚Äôre using at your conference for defaulting to a woman‚Äôs name, and point out all the ways Facebook is terrible when a table full of Facebook designers is right in front of her. I really value that, and before her, had seen plenty of men behave that way, but no women. She‚Äôs not afraid to hold people accountable, but doesn‚Äôt make it personal. She strikes a perfect balance, and getting to see her speak and attend one of her workshops was incredibly valuable to see as I‚Äôm working on developing my own speaking style. I was lucky enough to randomly be seated with her at a shared table at a restaurant we were both at after I saw her talk at a conference, and got to ask her all my questions and get amazing advice. I think that was the moment I started to feel like the universe really wants me to do this work. Serendipitous things like that keep happening. And I‚Äôm trying to pay it forward - I‚Äôm all about getting more women and other underrepresented voices into the conference speaking circuit.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My website is <a href=\"https://evapenzeymoog.com/\">evapenzeymoog.com</a> and my Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/epenzeymoog\">@epenzeymoog</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Eva PenzeyMoog, Designer Helping Stamp Out Domestic Abuse","path":"/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/26","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/PZhgAIc.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I started my career as a UX designer at a design agency. <strong>Being an introvert, I was very uncomfortable speaking in meetings and used to literally run away from having the spotlight on me.</strong> I even had a hard time speaking in front of my own team. Each time I stood up to talk I would get the classic symptoms such as dry mouth, profuse sweating, and forgetting what I wanted to say. It was frustrating because I noticed others who would get up and speak effortlessly and I wanted that for myself. I wanted to be able to get up and speak without hesitation and share my ideas.</p>\n<p>It was time to act.</p>\n<p>So I decided to turn things around and searched for ways to improve my public speaking skills. My search led me to a 30-day online speaking challenge which focused on specific areas in public speaking such as speed, filler words, pacing, etc. The last exercise of the challenge was to create a presentation of my own and record myself presenting it. At that time I was also diving into the world of sketching so I created a 5-minute talk about sketching journey. To test out my presentation I needed real people to present it to so I searched for meetups and found a developer meetup which was looking for presenters for their next meetup. Their CFP page was very inviting towards new speakers which gave me the confidence to apply. I jumped on the chance and submitted my talk proposal and that‚Äôs when my public speaking journey began.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>For me, it‚Äôs all about the people. Whether it‚Äôs someone who connects with my message or another speaker who is just starting out, I love meeting new people and making friends at conferences.</strong></p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely helped to improve my presentation skills. I am more confident in speaking in front of groups of people who I don‚Äôt know whereas before I would get nervous and my anxiety levels would go through the roof.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of speaking at conferences is that each conference brings its own challenges such as room layouts, the acoustics of rooms, the size of the audience, the distance to the audience, lighting, etc. these all present challenges that help us grow.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember my first conference talk very clearly because it was started out a bit rough. I was really nervous before the event because I didn‚Äôt know anyone in the sea of people. The layout of the room I was presenting it was a bit challenging. There was a big column right in the middle of the room which divided the audience into two sides. The windows were from floor to ceiling which sounds nice but made it extremely difficult to see my slides. We had to turn off the lights to be able to see them so I presented my talk in the dark, talk about throwing you off your game. As I began my presentation I noticed the people in the audience with their expressionless stares which made me think I was boring them. This started the negative self-talk in my head while I was presenting which never turns out well and it caused me to read my slides instead of looking at the audience. Towards the end, I felt much better and more in control of my talk. After the event, I felt a bit disheartened but I was determined to learn from the events of the day and improve for the next time.</p>\n<p>Each new talk presents challenges and opportunities to learn from and to help us grow. I am still learning from my ‚Äúmis-takes‚Äù and addressing the areas I need to improve in. It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that public speaking is a continuous learning process. Never stop learning.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/REn0gvq.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I haven‚Äôt kept count but I know I have applied to many conferences. My CFP rejected-to-win ratio is probably around 0.00001 which is definitely an exercise in learning how to accept rejection and not take it personally.</p>\n<p>I have presented at 6 conferences in the US and in Europe. My talk recently was accepted at a conference in Oslo which improves the ratio just a little bit.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>A week before my talk, my routine consists of getting a fresh haircut and picking out the outfit I will wear. I also make sure I have all the dongles, adapters, cables, remotes I need.</p>\n<p>On the day of the talk, I make sure I have a good breakfast and pack a few snacks just in case I get hungry before the talk.</p>\n<p>If I am speaking at a conference, I make sure to scope out the room I will be presenting in beforehand to check out the stage and seating arrangements. This way I can visualize myself up on the stage presenting beforehand, which help me feel prepared.</p>\n<p>Right before giving my talk I will do some breathing exercises, and if I really need to get pumped up then I will find stairs nearby and go up and down them quickly to warm up and get my blood flowing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>I recommend new speakers look for opportunities to present at work, meetups, schools, basically anywhere they can.</strong> At work, you can present at a Lunch and Learn session. Don‚Äôt have a Lunch and Learn session at work? Why not start one? This will give you the opportunity to present regularly and get more practice. Meetup organizers are always looking for new people to present and share their ideas. You can also start off with Lightning Talks which are short 5-minute presentations on any topic you want and are a great entry point to start your public speaking journey.</p>\n<p>Another tip I like to share is to make your talk interactive. <strong>Find ways to get your audience engaged with your message through exercises, questions, or discussions.</strong> Getting the audience involved will help them connect with your message on a deeper level and when the audience is engaged I notice that I relax more and become less anxious since.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Inspiration is everywhere. Whether it‚Äôs a team member presenting at work, a speaker at a conference, or kids presenting at an elementary school, I find inspiration by observing people and how they communicate. I have presented my talks at elementary schools and I‚Äôm especially inspired by the confidence kids have in standing up and sharing their ideas without hesitation which is something I am working towards.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>A good thing about having a somewhat unique name is that if you Google Rizwan Javaid, I will show up.

At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker‚Äôs Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Like many speakers I‚Äôve interviewed, Mike Miles understands that working in technology is about much more than just writing\ncode. While he has done plenty of that, Mike started speaking to raise his confidence and force himself to learn something new.\nNow, in addition to speaking at dozens of conferences, Mike hosts a podcast called Developing Up, which covers a wide range of\nnon-technical topics for software developers. We spoke about some of the <a href=\"https://www.developingup.com/episodes/43\">advantages of public speaking</a>\nfor your career on the show, but in this interview, Mike goes into some of his tips and the opportunities that speaking\nhas afforded him as well.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>Since 2009 I have worked at <a href=\"https://www.wearegenuine.com/\">Genuine, a full service digital agency headquartered in Boston MA, USA</a>. My current role is V.P. of Development, which entails leading the development department and the individuals in it. My day ranges anywhere from meeting with clients, building project estimates to fixing bugs, building features or leading technical architecture for a client project.</p>\n<p>I first got into public speaking by presenting lightning talks at local technology meetups. I started by asking development questions, presenting about projects I was working on and demoing solutions I had built. <strong>As an introverted person I was nervous about getting in front of and speaking to a large group of people.</strong> I knew for myself and for progression in my career, public speaking was something I wanted to improve on.</p>\n<p>In 2013 I started submitting talks to conferences and forced myself into the deep-end.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LLmOZiu.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Submitting talks is a great excuse to learn something new.</strong> When I submit a talk proposal it‚Äôs usually on a topic that I am not an expert on, but one that I am interested in learning more about. I then have a motivator to deep dive into the topic to learn about it. This has the challenge of learning enough about a topic to be able to present it in a way that others can understand.</p>\n<p>For technical talks in particular, this means being able to break down the subject into basic terms and concepts. This practice has come in very helpful for my career and day job interacting with clients. Being able to explain technical issues or aspects of your project in simple ways is very helpful for improving communication abilities.</p>\n<p>More self-serving is the added benefit of being able to travel to different locations around the world to present talks. Most technical conferences will cover the ticket cost (and sometimes airfare and lodging) for speakers. This affords me the opportunity to visit places I may not be able to on my own and get introduced to new communities of people. The benefit to my career from this is that I‚Äôm able to grow my professional network. As well as, I have opportunities to listen to a large range of talks by other great speakers.</p>\n<p>Finally there is the benefit of building up my self confidence. <strong>The more I present the more confident I become in my abilities to do so.</strong> This has helped with my social anxiety and with my ability to interact with clients or potential clients. Thanks to my years of public speaking I am now not afraid to join in on conversations with little or no preparations and be confident in what I am going to say.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was in June 2013 at the conference Design 4 Drupal, hosted at MIT in Cambridge MA. I co-presented with a co-worker on responsive design in a talk titled ‚ÄúBumps in the Road to Responsive‚Äù.</p>\n<p>As it was my first time speaking in front of a large group, I remember being very nervous about it. To prepare for the talk my co-presenter and I printed out scripts of exactly what we were going to say. Then we practiced many, many times, all the way up until the hour before our scheduled time slot. I do not remember much about presenting (it was all a blur), but we made it through it. People stayed through the whole thing and we had many follow up hallway conversations - which means attendees took away something helpful.</p>\n<p>My second time presenting and first time presenting solo, was in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-RQxA4JH6w\">April 2014 at a conference hosted at the UN building in New York City</a>. Again, I was very nervous about presenting and spent weeks rehearsing my talk. I had moved away from printing out a script and relied on having practiced my talk. That did not help my nerves and I remember hyperventilating, and my hands shaking. Yet I managed to get through it and covered all the points I wanted to talk about. I even managed to throw in a few (bad) jokes in my talk. At the end, I was very proud of what I accomplished and how I managed to present on my topic.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-RQxA4JH6w' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Mike Miles, ‚ÄúTo Patch Contrib or Write a Custom Module‚Äù</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Since 2013, I have applied to 40 different conferences a majority of which have been tech focused. Of those 40 I have spoken at 34 conferences, presenting 38 talks on 9 different subjects. This has given me a chance to present at conference in 4 different countries (US, Canada, Iceland &#x26; Germany). On average I build about 1 - 2 new technical topics a year, and present each at 5 - 6 different conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>After every presentation I take time reflect on how well I did and think of ways I can improve my process. This has lead to an evolution of a pre-talk routine that works for me.</p>\n<p>My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. <strong>I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud.</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I present my talk to a brick wall and yes it looks and feels awkward, but that is the point.</p>\n<p>I practice the way I‚Äôll present the talk to work out the quirks and get the flow correct. By the time I‚Äôve spent a week doing this, presenting my talk becomes muscle memory. I then do not have to worry about what I‚Äôm going to say and can instead focus on how I‚Äôm saying it. This allows me to react to any audience questions and manage my allotted time. This is the most important part of my pre-talk of my routine. After this time I DO NOT edit my presentation, doing so would only throw everything off.</p>\n<p>The day before and day of my talk I prepare my body. <strong>I start by making sure to get to bed at a respectable time and get a full night‚Äôs rest.</strong></p>\n<p>The morning of I have a good breakfast and if possible practice one last time. The hardest part of this phase is that I do not drink any coffee or caffeine leading up to my talk. <strong>I have found that since I still get nervous any caffeine over activates my nerves and leads to me speaking quickly and being shaky during my talk.</strong> I also use the day before / morning of to prepare backups of my presentation. I create a PDF version (that I can then share with the audience), back up to a cloud service, create a short link and if possible place it on a USB device. This way if anything catastrophic happens to my laptop or the internet goes down, I can still give my talk.</p>\n<p>The hour before my talk I spend clearing my mind. I‚Äôll take a break from the conference I‚Äôm at, take a small walk and focus my mind on nothing. This time gives me a chance to calm down and relax. Fifteen minutes before my talk I find the room I‚Äôll be presenting in (if I have not already done so) and sit in on the talk currently being given (if there is one).</p>\n<p>Then it‚Äôs time for me to get on stage, hook up my laptop and start talking!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you do not have to be an expert to present on a technical topic.</strong> Build a presentation around an interest. You do not have to be a subject matter expert and building a talk is a great motivator to learn something new.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>practice, practice, practice and practice out loud!</strong> You will not get a feel for your talk by practicing it ‚Äúin your head‚Äù. Practice the way you present your talk. Standing up, hooked up to a monitor and not facing your slides. This allows you to build a muscle memory around what and how you are going to present.</p>\n<p>Third, when possible <strong>practice your talk in front of a trusted friend or family.</strong> Ideally someone who is not knowledgeable of the material. They will catch things about your presentation that you are not aware of and give you helpful feedback on the story you are telling. I cannot tell you the number of spelling and grammar mistakes my wife has found in my presentations.</p>\n<p>Fourth, <strong>do not be the person that edits your presentation hours/minutes leading up to your talk.</strong> Doing so means you are going to have to figure out what you want say while presenting. Losing the message / lesson you want to convey to your audience.</p>\n<p>Number five is <strong>do not be afraid to submit your talk to many conferences.</strong> You do not need to build a new talk for every CFP and the information you‚Äôve built will be beneficial for many audiences. Plus the more times you give your talk the better you will become at it.</p>\n<p>Finally, number six, <strong>mistakes will happen and when they do move on.</strong> I‚Äôve seen some technical talks derailed because the presenter spent too long trying to get a code example to work, or wait for a file to load due to a bad internet connection. If something is not going correct, move on to the next part of your talk, your audience will thank you.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers who I have looked up to and have inspired my career as a technical speaker. The first is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Crell\">Larry Garfield</a>. Larry outlined the methods he‚Äôs used to build technical talks and his guidelines. These have helped me numerous times to build session proposals that have been accepted by conferences. <a href=\"https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch\">You can read Larry‚Äôs guidelines here</a>.</p>\n<p>The second speaker is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eaton\">Jeff Eaton</a>. Every time I have seen Jeff present, it is with enthusiasm and passion for what he is presenting on. As an attendee at one of his talks you feel this in the way he presents and you walk away feeling empowered (at least this has been my experience). The way Jeff Eaton presents is something I have striven to replicate in my own presentation style.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Interested readers can find out more about me in a number of different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can hear my voice monthly as the <a href=\"https://www.developingup.com\">host of the Developing Up podcast</a> - a podcast that is focused on the non-technical side of being a developer and growing a career in development.</li>\n<li>I can be found on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devuppodcast\">@devuppodcast</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemiles86\">@mikemiles86</a>.</li>\n<li>All of my previous technical talks and upcoming speaking engagements can be found on my website at <a href=\"http://www.mike-miles.com\">www.mike-miles.com</a>.</li>\n<li>And I‚Äôm always happy to connect on LinkedIn at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/\">linkedin.com/in/mikemiles86/</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Mike Miles, Podcaster Focused on the Nontechnical Side of Technology","path":"/blog/speakers-mike-miles/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/07/16","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1aiVLNLBPbgjq_2LlEvHL4MzyfKpIB_DT"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

One thing I love about speaking is getting to attend conferences and hear other talks - especially from subject-matter experts who are truly passionate about their craft. Bailey is one of those passionate people, and I‚Äôm excited to bring you her story here today.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm director of content strategy at usability consulting firm <a href=\"https://truematter.com/\">truematter</a> out of Columbia, South Carolina. I‚Äôm a user experience content strategist which means I plan, organize, and write the words people use to interact with websites, applications, and software products. I‚Äôve been involved in public speaking throughout my life, especially when I was younger.</p>\n<p>Recently, I felt a call to pick it up again for many reasons but one in particular: design and development teams must change their approach to words online. Many, many organizations (including those that should know better) still write their online content the same way they would for traditional media. That approach drags down their product‚Äôs user experience, makes it harder for customers to engage with them online, and has a large negative impact on the success of their digital products. I set out to speak out about this widespread problem and how we should fix it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/l6UnYFz.jpg\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm still pretty new on the conference scene but even so, <strong>I‚Äôve already made a lot of connections with both people in my field and those outside of it.</strong> I think it‚Äôs a lot easier to meet people when you‚Äôre the one giving the presentation because 1) people already know a topic they can discuss with you which cuts out a lot of networking small talk and 2) people come up to you instead of you having to approach them every time ‚Äì a real plus for an introvert like me.</p>\n<p>Also, I‚Äôve found so far speaking is a great way to visit new places ‚Äì I often take a couple of days before or after to explore the area outside of the conference hotel.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It went well! I think I was surprised when I found out that people do actually care a great deal about their digital content and want to know how to make it better and more usable. The audience had a ton of questions, which was great. The whole thing is kind of addicting. You experience it once and think, ‚ÄúI want to do that again.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve spoken at about ten events so far with another four or five already scheduled for later this year.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to a lot more than that for sure. I probably send out three applications a month and that number has been growing lately. But <strong>the more I apply and the more I speak, the more conferences are approaching me instead of the other way around and that‚Äôs a really nice feeling.</strong></p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATVKZdl_pEw?start=130' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Bailey Lewis at OKC Design Tech</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I always try to see the space before I speak in it. That could mean swinging by the room before my presentation or trying to find a video of a presentation someone else gave in that room online. Seeing the space before my presentation lets me decide where to stand and helps me understand how the audience will be looking at my slides (one big screen? multiple screens around the room? etc).</p>\n<p>Other than that, <strong>I take a deep breath and remind myself: The audience came to see me present on this topic.</strong> They want it to go well as much as I do. And that‚Äôs a lot more helpful than imagining them in their underwear.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>If you‚Äôre brand new, it might be hard to find speaking gigs that will cover your travel and accommodations. The conference might even ask you to pay to attend even though you‚Äôre speaking (not my favorite practice but there you have it).</p>\n<p>Take a few of these gigs if you need to so you can get started and get your name out there, but as soon as someone offers to cover your travel/accommodations, demand it every time you speak afterward. Even better if you can throw a speaker stipend into the mix. That will probably mean saying no to conferences you‚Äôd really like to speak at, which can be painful. But once you reach certain level in your speaking career, you shouldn‚Äôt be digging in your own pockets when you‚Äôre the one providing the presentation content that will sell conference tickets and make the event successful.</p>\n<p>By the way, <strong>I love that CFP Land lists which ‚Äúperks‚Äù each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don‚Äôt have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I‚Äôm expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting.</strong></p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm not sure about specific conference speakers (although there are presentations I‚Äôve really enjoyed), but my father is a trial attorney and, among other speaking-related lessons, he taught me the art of giving a presentation without swaying or fidgeting. He would record me giving a presentation and then have me watch it back ‚Äì it was extremely effective for getting rid of the fidgets.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>Find me at <a href=\"https://truematter.com/baileylewis\">truematter.com/baileylewis</a>.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fXaa5bp.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>When I was in college, I was paralyzed by the fear of public speaking. Just the thought of talking in front of a small class would cause cold-sweats. Fortunately, I was studying for a career in Comp Sci. which usually doesn‚Äôt require much public speaking.</p>\n<p>Once my career began, I was reaffirmed, no one wants to hear a developer speak. That was fine for a few years, and then new nagging energy began. People can‚Äôt listen if you don‚Äôt speak. Quietly interjecting important points without ever taking the lead of a conversation is less effective than not speaking at all. It was time to start breaking out of my shell.</p>\n<p><strong>Though I was uncomfortable, I started speaking up more and more.</strong> I attended conferences, and I marveled at speakers. I was amazed, but sure I would never be on the other side of the 4th wall.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can‚Äôt shut me up. It‚Äôs always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn‚Äôt comfortable, but it‚Äôs doable. Now <a href=\"http://gantlaborde.com/\">you can see I‚Äôve been speaking actively for years</a>.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm very fortunate that I work for the great people at <a href=\"https://infinite.red/\">Infinite Red</a> who have supported me from lightning talk to keynote speaker.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>The best thing about speaking at conferences is the networking and connection. I‚Äôve made friends around the world.</strong> This has, directly AND indirectly, benefited my career and employer. It‚Äôs not required in my job description, but it‚Äôs valuable to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs something impressive about going to a city for the first time, and have people walk up and introduce themselves to me, mentioning past talks or blog posts. I‚Äôm still an introvert, but it doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, something like that feels great. The community and positivity of it all is superb!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>After a lot of Toastmasters, and speaking at a local meetup, my first ‚Äúconference‚Äù talk was a lightning slot at RubyConf 2013.</p>\n<p>How‚Äôd it go?

Then it‚Äôs to fill a room, then get invited to speak, then keynote.</strong> The best speakers are people who have been leveling up for 20+ years, and they support and promote speakers who are just getting started.

I often learn things and I enjoy disseminating the information from stages and then having conversations about it later. <strong>Truth be told, I enjoy the private conversations that happen after a good talk <em>a lot</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>While it has directly benefited my career with a number of job offers, visibility, Twitter followers, all kinds of glitz and glam, the real value I see from this type of engagement is the love. I get to share hope with people, combat impostor syndrome, and see careers flourish; life change from a stage. It‚Äôs all very encouraging.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember doing a TEDx talk like 7 years ago. It was really well received. I think there was even a standing ovation. It was fun. üôÇ</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUIcTl9Hto4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tejas presenting ‚ÄúPapercuts Can Kill‚Äù at TEDx</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I‚Äôve applied to like 20 and spoken at like 9? It‚Äôs a gut feeling though. I have no real idea.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I often put myself into the mindset of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve won‚Äù already before I even play.</strong> This gives me hope and like prepares me to do an amazing job. Eventually, it somehow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Odd, maybe, but it works for me every time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You‚Äôd be surprised by how much value you can add with a talk. Our tech industry today is so full of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1126096390281732097\">faux confidence and pretend knowledge</a> that one would often feel like they don‚Äôt know enough ‚Äì I know I feel this way most of the time. The truth is, I actually know quite a bit <em>in my own, very specific area</em> that I can use to educate and help others who aren‚Äôt as familiar with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I‚Äôm often insecure about kubernetes, data structures and algorithms, and CS fundamentals because I personally was always too sick to get a Computer Science degree. I don‚Äôt have one. I am a prime example of impostor syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, I feel there are just as many people insecure about React, TypeScript, CSS and other areas. I rejoice at the idea of combating their impostor syndrome with my experience in these subjects. For me, this is part of the joy of public speaking along these themes.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve always been extremely uncomfortable with my <em>content</em> not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I‚Äôve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to better my technical abilities to ‚Äúclose the loop‚Äù.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve been inspired by a lot of speakers, inside and outside of tech circles. I especially appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweststrate\">Michel Weststrate</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a>‚Äôs speaking styles as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darcar31\">Daria Caraway</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôm most active on twitter under <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tejaskumar_\">@tejaskumar_</a>. I also have a website where people can learn to code and/or troll me depending on their mood at <a href=\"https://tejaskumar.com/\">tejaskumar.com</a>.</p>\n<p>My next talk is not yet announced, but one talk coming up is at JSConf Budapest about the performance of various UI frameworks in serverless architectures.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: Tejas Kumar, Lifelong Speaker and Frontend Development Lead","path":"/blog/speakers-story-tejas-kumar/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/06/29","image":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Wsb2E7Wl1wL9UMT-aYT1XZKn2kan8tL3"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>During the day I‚Äôm a senior software engineer at a company called MoreCommerce where we do small and medium-sized business e-commerce and market place offerings. Outside of that, I help maintain various API related OSS projects like Fractal, openapi.tools, standards.rest and a few others. I spend most of my free time doing photography or cycling.</p>\n<p>As for speaking, I got my start at my old PHP user group in Atlanta. I started with a lightning talk and moved up to a full-length talk before breaking into a conference. Im usually pretty shy and quiet, so it was weird at first but it been a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about speaking is <strong>it‚Äôs an excuse to learn and play with new technology</strong>. I wouldn‚Äôt have become passionate about the OpenAPI spec if a conference hadn‚Äôt given me a chance to speak on it for example. And because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, <strong>giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn‚Äôt touch at work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It feels so long ago, but my first talk was at a now-defunct conference called ‚ÄúGreat Wide Open‚Äù. I submitted a talk essentially about why community is awesome and how it can help someone learn. Since it was my first talk I was incredibly nervous but somehow I pulled it off. I got good feedback for it, and felt like I could have massaged it a bit into a more full talk.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>This year I will have spoken at 5, including 2 (maybe 3) keynotes. That‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever done. Last year I spoke at one conference.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I usually put on some music, like Run The Jewels and just zone out.</strong> I tend not to sit in a talk before my slot so I can keep my thoughts going. Everyone is different, what works for me doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll work for someone else. I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing. I‚Äôm also bad in that I will still be doing slides up until my talk. I should fix that.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For your first talk, <strong>pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgable about.</strong> Don‚Äôt experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.</p>\n<p>When you submit your CFP, check your spelling and grammar. It‚Äôs amazing how many people overlook it.</p>\n<p>Another thing is <strong>don‚Äôt immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, submit multiple submissions, it gives you better odds. When we organized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/southeastphp\">Southeast PHP</a>, people with multiple submissions had a better shot getting into our post-apocalyptic Thunderdome over someone who only gave us one thing to choose.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I‚Äôm thrilled to bring you Drishti‚Äôs story today, and hope it inspires you to get out and do some good in the world!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w36pjbN.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I am Drishti Jain a Computer Engineer at heart and a technology enthusiast. I love to use technology to help the less fortunate. I am a social entrepreneur. I am the Co-founder and President of the non-profit organisation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samyakdrishtifoundation\">Samyak Drishti Foundation</a> which works in environment, education and healthcare sectors in 10 cities across India. I have been titled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoptimistcitizen/p/BdT0mVJnMhU/\">Eco-Warrior thrice by the Government of Maharashtra, India</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been a good orator since a young age. I got into public speaking at school in grade 4; when I had to give a speech on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (for his birth anniversary). Ever since, I‚Äôve loved the stage and sharing knowledge with all. Fun Fact: I also host music concerts sometimes :)</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences about things that I am passionate about. While I continue to learn new things and develop myself, I like to share my learning with others. Speaking at conferences, I am sharing with everyone about how cool a technology is or how I make the most of a feature. It gives me immense satisfaction to share my knowledge with all.</p>\n<p>I have learnt a lot speaking at conferences. I would like to share my secret weapon to effectively speaking in front large audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>My secret weapon ‚Äì the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause.</strong> These are three key parts of speaking effectively at conferences. Using this paradigm, I am able to more effectively deliver my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Moreover, speaking at conferences I am able to share my learning with all and give them a head start in the technology. I am believer of ‚ÄúLearning by sharing Knowledge‚Äù and speaking at conferences just fuels that!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was an exciting experience. Post deciding my topic (after a lot of brainstorming) I realized that I had just entered the long hiking trail of preparing my talk, yet to embark. There was a mountain of information I had gathered through research on the topic. And I had to create my talk in a way that I would cover maximum information and make it interesting. <strong>It all seemed overwhelming at first; but I decide to sit and create a summary of the information, that made it easy to prepare my talk.</strong></p>\n<p>On the day of the conference, I reached the venue early and checked if my laptop was compatible with the system; it was all ok and I was set to present my talk. Having reached early, I got comfortable with the environment and eagerly waited for my talk slot.</p>\n<p>I gave my talk and had a good Q and A for my talk; which gave me the assurance and satisfaction that I presented well and attendees were listening keenly.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing experience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Considering events, workshops, tech talks, conferences I have spoken at about 30-40; including a few virtual speaking engagements.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I attend the talk before my talk to set into the energy of the conference hall. <strong>I also do a demo practice with a friend to gain feedback.</strong></p>\n<p>I feel enthusiastic over nervous before my talk. I believe I have learned to convert my nervous energy into enthusiasm by practicing before my talk. I know it can be difficult due to packed schedules of the conference and work; but I do make sure to make time to practice. Sometimes I skim through my talk contents or rehearse the complete talk depending on the time I can make in my schedule.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I will encourage new speakers to speak about what they are truly passionate about. <strong>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present.</strong> It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!</p>\n<p>If you feel crunching everything you love about the topic into the 30/45 min talk is getting on to you, <strong>go outside and have fresh air. It will help you have a clear head and invoke creativity in your talk.</strong> It is very trivial to know the audience you will be presenting for. Most importantly remember to be yourself and be excited to share with the world what you like about the technology.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I got inspired by the talk by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pranavmistry\">Pranav Mistry</a> on the Sixth-Sense technology. I liked how he presented the technology and included components in the talk that could be understood by someone new in the technology space. It has inspired me to include an overview of concepts related to my topic in the beginning of my talk for a couple of minutes, so that a participant novice to the topic understands the overall picture and doesn‚Äôt feel left out.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrtANPtnhyg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>TEDIndia: The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology by Pranav Mistry</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am active on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drishtijjain\">@drishtijjain</a>.
