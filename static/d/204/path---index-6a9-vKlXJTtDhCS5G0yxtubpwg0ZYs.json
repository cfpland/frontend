While new to speaking at conferences, Rhia obviously has a gift for communication, and sometimes beginners are actually the best people to take advice from. Read on to hear Rhia‚Äôs fresh approach to tech conference speaking and some of the fantastic women in tech who have inspired her.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GLa6cwP.png\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm a software engineer from Kansas City, Missouri. I love to tech, and I love to share the cool things I‚Äôve learned with other people.</p>\n<p>I have always enjoyed going to schools to speak to students, but I was intrigued by conference speaking. One fateful evening I told <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a>, founder of Kansas City Women in Technology, that I was interested in speaking at tech conferences. She volunteered to be my mentor, set me up with resources for writing abstracts, and she sent me links to open CFPs for various conferences for me to begin submitting those abstracts. It felt like a whirlwind of events‚Ä¶I was writing abstracts the first week of December 2018, submitting those to conferences within the next week, and I got my first acceptance in January!</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>What I like about public speaking is that it puts me in a new place to help other people. I am thrilled that I‚Äôm providing content that people want to hear, and content that they can take something from to apply to their lives.</p>\n<p>I do believe it has benefited my career, and it has helped me to shine a light on the things I believe are great.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference was DevFest KC this past February in Kansas City. <strong>I was super nervous, and I told the audience this was my first time speaking at a conference. I‚Äôm used to trying to engage small groups of teenagers, not 20-40 adults.</strong> However, I needn‚Äôt have worried so much. My audience was engaged, they asked questions, and they were eager to participate. By the end of the talk, they didn‚Äôt believe that was my first time.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312227563\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          \n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/312227563\">Rhia Dixon at the KC Women in Technology 2019 Kickoff</a></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>At the time of this response, I have applied to 28 conferences. Thus far, I have been accepted to speak at 6 of the 16 conferences that have announced their speakers (1 of which I‚Äôve already done).</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine consists of taking one last look at my slides, a few deep breaths, and listening to whatever song that currently has my ears hostage (typically something upbeat and relatively positive with great musicality).</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I would pass on some of the best advice I‚Äôve received:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick a topic that you wouldn‚Äôt mind speaking about for hours and make it interesting for the version of you that would benefit from the talk.</li>\n<li>Write your abstract in such a way that the reader gets a pretty good understanding of why they should be at your talk and what they will get from attending.</li>\n<li>While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you‚Äôve got friends in the audience ‚Äî some you may know, and some you may not know‚Ä¶yet.</li>\n<li>Find people from varying backgrounds to read your abstracts ‚Äî <strong>I have a speaker in tech, a speaker not in tech, and a non-speaker in tech review all of my abstracts to tell me what they think the point is, what they would expect to learn, and offer alternative titles.</strong> I‚Äôve found this particularly helpful for tweaking my abstracts and tailoring my talks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Oh, I have plenty! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/likeOMGitsFEDAY\">Jennifer Wadella</a> is one of my favorites ‚Äî I know her, she‚Äôs relatable, she doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously, and she has a ball on stage sharing what she knows. I‚Äôm also inspired by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/techgirl1908\">Angie Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrShirleyDavis\">Dr. Shirley Davis</a>. I aspire to these levels of awesomeness and badassery.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?

I currently work at Comcast where I am the lead web developer for xFi. My first public presentation was at a Sass meetup in Philadelphia in 2012 where I volunteered to talk about a new open source project I was working on. From there I spoke at a few ‚Äúunconferences‚Äù &#x26; ‚Äúunconference tracks‚Äù at other conferences (where basically as long as you show up and there‚Äôs an open speaking slot, it‚Äôs yours) before I was first accepted to speak at a conference.</p>\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxfoundation/44425350705/in/faves-17844497@N00/\">The Linux Foundation, some rights reserved</a></em></p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>The thing I enjoy the most is sharing my experiences, both on stage and in the conversations with attendees afterwards. It has also allowed me to travel to some fun and interesting places.</p>\n<p>There are a couple areas where it has directly benefited my career. <strong>I was given the opportunity to <a href=\"http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Sass-Converting-Existing-Site/434463-2.html\">create a course for Lynda.com</a> because I met Lynda.com staff author <a href=\"http://www.raybo.org/\">Ray Villalobos</a> after we both spoke at a conference.</strong> It turned out that we were both speaking at another conference a few months later, so he made a point to check out my talk at that conference. He enjoyed it so he recommended me as a course author. Prior to that I had not even considered authoring a course, and after he sold me on the idea, it because a reality that never would have been had I not met Ray. In addition, at my current role at Comcast I am expected to be having an impact outside of the company, and public speaking is the path I‚Äôve been leaning on to accomplish that.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>The first conference I was accepted to speak at via a CFP was the University of Illinois Web Conference in 2015. When I talked to folks that attended afterwards, everyone had good things to say, but given it was my first talk I essentially took that as I did not too anything terribly wrong, which was a great first step.</p>\n<p>My favorite talk I‚Äôve given so far is ‚ÄúThe Critical Career Path Conversation‚Äù which I premiered at The Lead Developer NYC in 2018. You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLBzScQzZ83I8H8_0Qete6Bs5EcW3p0kZF&#x26;v=hMz6QDURQOM\">view it on YouTube</a>, including a fun glitch about one-third of the way through for you all to enjoy watching me struggle &#x26; recover from.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMz6QDURQOM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to about 70 so far and spoken at 20.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it üòú.</p>\n<p>I usually spend the hour before looking and my slide notes one last time and inevitably tweak a few things here or there. My system is to write out what I‚Äôm planning to say for each slide in the slide notes but then I rarely ever follow it directly once I start talking. It‚Äôs just a comfort feeling knowing that if I totally forget what I was going to say, the script is there.</p>\n<p>The last thing I do, which I do recommend, is to <strong>make sure you start off smiling</strong> üòÉ.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is so much I could say here but I‚Äôll limit it to a few quick hits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Imposter syndrome is real and a totally normal feeling</strong>, so do not let that hold you back. Especially early on, I always had a feeling of ‚Äúeveryone in the audience will already know what I‚Äôm talking about.‚Äù That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>During the intro of your talk, let the audience know how you intend to take questions (raise your hand during the talk, hold them until the end, chat in the hallway later, email, etc.). If someone asks a question that you don‚Äôt know the answer to, it is much better to say ‚ÄúThat is a great question. I don‚Äôt know what the answer is so let me get back to you,‚Äù than to try to make up an answer on the spot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My CFP acceptance rate went up when I internalized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344\">this piece of advice from Fluent organizer Kyle Simpson</a>:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/advice?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#advice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/designingATalk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#designingATalk</a><br><br>OK talks are about the topic.<br><br>Good talks are about the speaker/presentation.<br><br>Great talks are about the audience.</p>&mdash; getify (@getify) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getify/status/804018344412217344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 30, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are 2 in particular that I look up to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://meowni.ca/\">Monica Dinculescu</a> because when it comes to technical knowledge, she does an excellent job of taking a topic and distilling it down so that the audience can understand it and apply it immediately. She is able to do it while keeping her talk entertaining with healthy doses of humor and emojis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.agiledeveloper.com/\">Venkat Subramaniam</a> is a marathon speaker that I am amazed by. He is a superhuman when it comes to learning new content and teaching it. At the last conference I spoke at, Venkat delivered a full day workshop on the first day and then gave a talk at literally every possible speaking slot over the course of the next 3 days, which totaled 13 separate 90 minute talks. The thing that amazes me even more (especially given my typical pre-talk routine) is he has no slides. He starts off each talk with some bullet point topics in a text editor and the magic happens from there.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you? Your next conference talk?</h3>\n<p>I tweet infrequently at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnriv?lang=en\">@JohnRiv</a>. In the middle of July I‚Äôll be at <a href=\"https://uberconf.com\">√úberConf</a> in Denver running a full-day workshop on Web Components and giving a couple talks in the days that follow. As the name suggests, √úberConf covers a ton of topics related to software development, and Venkat Subramaniam will be speaking there, so if you‚Äôre not already familiar with the conference, check it out!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>If you‚Äôre a tech conference speaker, email <a href=\"mailto:karl@cfpland.com\">karl@cfpland.com</a> to tell your story. üíå</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Speaker‚Äôs Story: John Riviello, Frontend Web Developer","path":"/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/","category":"Speaker's Story","tags":null,"date":"2019/05/25","image":"https://i.imgur.com/6V1TS6n.jpg"}}},{"post":{"html":"<p><em>Technology conference speakers come from a wide range of backgrounds,\nexperience levels, and interests.

Jaime has spoken at a lot of conferences, but like many of us, he‚Äôs applied at an order of magnitude more. Read on to learn more about his process and some of his suggestions for new speakers.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ozbikNQ.png\" class=\"left\">\n<p>I‚Äôm Jaime Lopez Jr and I‚Äôm a software developer by day and a podcaster by night.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking because I wanted to reach a new audience where I could share my knowledge, experiences, and stories. I‚Äôve co-hosted a podcast (<a href=\"https://mtjc.fireside.fm/\">More Than Just Code</a>) for the past 4-5 years, so public speaking was a natural extension of that experience.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like being able to share things that I have learned because I hope that my experiences can be helpful to others who encounter the same struggles that I have encountered.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has benefited my career by providing an opportunity to meet other people in the industry that I wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily get a chance to meet!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first conference talk. I co-presented a talk at 360iDev in Denver, Colorado with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timmitra\">Tim Mitra</a> (my friend and a co-host of More Than Just Code).</p>\n<p>The talk went very well from what I recall. The topic was about the way that hosting a technical podcast can help developers in their careers, which plays to our strengths as experienced podcasters. Of course it also helped that we had a few die-hard fans in the audience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Looking at my Google Sheets spreadsheet where I track this, I‚Äôve applied to about <strong>115 conferences in the past three years or so</strong>. I‚Äôve been accepted by 14 conferences and have spoken at (or am scheduled to speak at) 9 of those conferences.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I like to find a quiet place to collect my thoughts about an hour prior to when I give my presentation. It certainly helps when there is a dedicated room for speakers to do this! Also, if possible I try to check out the room where I‚Äôll be speaking so I can get a sense of the acoustics as well as how the audience will experience the presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>I generally try not to memorize my talks because it causes me to become robotic when speaking</strong>. Instead, I walk through the main points (generally a single word) that I want to mention related to my slides or code that I‚Äôm sharing.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>There is one main piece of advice that I can give new speakers:</p>\n<p><strong>It is usually difficult to get started as a conference speaker in terms of getting your CFP submissions accepted. This is totally okay and you don‚Äôt need to worry about it!</strong></p>\n<p>I subscribed to the (now-defunct) <a href=\"https://techspeak.email/\">Technically Speaking newsletter</a> that was put together by Chiu-Ki Chan and Cate Huston. The content in that newsletter (which is still available online) helped me craft my CFP submissions so that there is a better chance of being accepted. As well, the Technically Speaking newsletter helped me feel better about CFP acceptance rates (which if I recall they said was somewhere about 10%).</p>\n<p>If I‚Äôve learned anything over the past few years of submitting to CFPs, <strong>it‚Äôs that it is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference</strong> (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP).</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are two speakers that come to mind.</p>\n<p>First is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/savinola\">Laura Savino</a>. The way she gives technical presentations makes the audience feel as if they‚Äôre going along on a shared journey. Each step of the way seems like a friend is sharing their favorite locations in an unfamiliar city.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkb9z68nhyo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Readable Code - Laura Savino - DDD Europe 2018</em></p>\n<p>Second is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmeans\">Nickolas Means</a>. I‚Äôve been impressed with the way that he can smoothly deliver stories that involve a lot of technical detail. The way he presents the topics at hand leaves the audience on the edge of their seat.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?
