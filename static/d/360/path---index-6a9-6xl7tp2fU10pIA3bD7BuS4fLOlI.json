I really love when technology speakers draw parallels to events and characters outside of our industry, so his talk on leadership lessons learned through the underground railroad was right up my alley. Anjuan is a prolific and talented speaker who‚Äôs spoken at over 50 conferences across the world, so I‚Äôm very excited to bring his story to you here today. In this interview, Anjuan outlines some of the topics he‚Äôs passionate about and lessons he‚Äôs learned on his speaker‚Äôs journey.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HuvC1ME68I' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Anjuan Simmons at The Lead Dev Austin</em></p>\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CXHhfJH.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I‚Äôm an Engineering Coach at Help Scout, and my daily job is to make sure that the engineers on my team are successful and that we‚Äôre shipping features that our customers love.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking at a young age. I did one-act plays in high school, and I also competed in <a href=\"https://www.uiltexas.org/speech/oral-interp/2019-20-uil-poetry-categories\">UIL poetry interpretation</a>. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the ability of human speech to change the world, and I hope that my public speaking is a small brick in the enormous wall of humanity‚Äôs ongoing attempt to make ourselves better.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences!</p>\n<p>I give my talks because <strong>I believe that I have something to say that will help the attendees be better at the work they do</strong>. So, speaking is a way that I can help people, and helpfulness is one of my core values. There‚Äôs nothing better than the feeling I get when people come up to me after my talk (or sometimes weeks/months later) and tell me how it changed the way they thought about the topic. It‚Äôs even better when they share how it changed their behavior!</p>\n<p>Speaking isn‚Äôt part of my job, but it has greatly benefited my career. During job interviews, <strong>I‚Äôve had interviewers tell me how much they loved my talks!</strong> While giving great talks alone wouldn‚Äôt have gotten me the offer, being qualified and a good speaker has been an incredible combination!</p>\n<h3>What topics do you typically speak about?</h3>\n<p>My two primary topics are technology leadership and diversity and inclusion. My technology leadership talks draw on core principles as well as historical examples.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/leadership-lessons-from-the-agile-manifesto/\">Leadership Lessons from the Agile Manifesto</a> talk takes the values of the <a href=\"https://agilemanifesto.org/\">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a> and distills lessons for engineering managers and technical leads. I give easy to understand guidelines for making the tough decisions that leaders have to make when guiding engineering teams.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/technical-leadership-through-the-underground-railroad/\">Technical Leadership Through the Underground Railroad</a> talk uses the story of the daring John P. Parker who was a Conductor on the legendary Underground Railroad. I use his experience helping a group of enslaved people in 19th Century America escape from the Slave States to freedom.</p>\n<p>I give a talk with my wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons, called <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/managing-the-burnout-burndown/\">Managing the Burnout Burndown</a>, and we use the burndown chart used my many Agile teams as a metaphor for burning down stress. We describe how protecting your health, forming strong relationships, and removing distractions can help you avoid burn out.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://anjuansimmons.com/talks/lending-privilege/\">Lending Privilege</a> talk describes how everyone has privilege and can use it to create a more diverse and inclusive technology industry. We can all help those who lack our privileges be more visible, have their voices heard, and get a chance to contribute their expertise to the software development process at our companies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was at Podcamp Houston back in 2009. I think it went very well!</p>\n<p>My talk was called ‚ÄúRestoring Tech Cred to Houston‚Äù, and I made the case for Houston being an often overlooked tech hub when compared to other areas of the country like Silicon Valley, New York City, and Austin. One thing that‚Äôs important to know about this first talk was that I had the fortune of getting a lot of speaking experience as a normal part of my job. As an engineering manager, I did a lot of speaking as a person tasked with leading development teams. Of course, this work was done inside company walls and was not visible to the public. However, I found that when I did start public speaking I already had a great set of skills just from what I did at work.</p>\n<p><strong>So, if you‚Äôre a new speaker, you probably are more experienced than you realize if your job requires you to do a lot of communication (even if it‚Äôs just in small team meetings or Slack conversations).</strong></p>\n<p>My first large conference talk was at South by Southwest in 2010, and I went on to speak there several times. I started to really get serious about speaking at conferences when I did a Lightning Talk at OSCON in 2016. That‚Äôs when my public speaking work really began to take off!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I would guess over 500. I‚Äôve spoken at about 50 conferences so that tells you how tough the ratio of applications to acceptances can be.</p>\n<p>Speaking at conferences is a numbers game, and <strong>you shouldn‚Äôt let the rejection emails get you down</strong>. I‚Äôve spoken at conferences on three different continents, and I still regularly get rejected. Keep applying and refining your proposals. You‚Äôll start getting acceptances which usually lead to a higher acceptance rate.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>My pre-talk routine is meant to minimize variables and distractions as much as possible. I avoid drinking or eating anything two hours before my talk. That reduces the chance that I‚Äôll have an upset stomach or have to deal with digestion issues. I may drink coffee, but no later than 30 minutes before I go on stage (to avoid being too jittery).</p>\n<p>I make sure I‚Äôve been mic‚Äôd and have done a sound check and laptop check at least 30 minutes before my talk. I want to make sure that the mic is working, my slides are properly displayed on the screens, and my clicker (I use a <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote\">Logitech Spotlight</a>) and laptop are both fully charged.</p>\n<p>I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified. üòÉ</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>First, <strong>you have something to say</strong>. Even an entry level talk can provide a ton of value. There is always someone who is new to the topic and needs help understanding the core concepts. Also, <strong>even people who are experts need reminders best practices and first principles</strong>. So, don‚Äôt count yourself out just because you think you‚Äôre not an expert.</p>\n<p>Second, pick one or two topics that you‚Äôre passionate about and use those for your talk proposals. You know you‚Äôre passionate about a topic if you‚Äôre already spending a lot of time reading about it, thinking about it, and debating it with people on Twitter. Wrap your talks around your passions. That way, you won‚Äôt get tired of your talks (it can happen over time), and the audience will sense your excitement. If you‚Äôre not excited about what you‚Äôre talking about, then how can the people in the seats get excited about you?</p>\n<p>Third, rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. I‚Äôve given a lot of talks, and I still get nervous. However, the best remedy I‚Äôve found for anxiety about stepping on stage is rehearse. You don‚Äôt have to memorize everything you‚Äôre going to say, but you need to have a solid idea of the journey you‚Äôre taking the audience on in your talk.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I look up to and have been inspired by so many speakers.

After speaking at local several meetups, Adri√°n started applying to conferences and has now been a speaker at 4 international gatherings. One of my favorite parts about speaking is the same as Adri√°n‚Äôs: meeting people from around the world.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sZRtBDT.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>My name is Adri√°n Bolonio. I‚Äôm an experienced Spanish Frontend developer and Web Team Lead, focusing now in Web Accessibility (a11y). Since 2012 I‚Äôve been living and working in Vienna. I currently work at <a href=\"www.willhaben.at\">willhaben</a>, the biggest classified company in Austria with the 2nd highest traffic of all Austrian websites.</p>\n<p>I started speaking at local meetups in Vienna, such as ViennaJS, ReactJS and then I talked at the DevFest Vienna, organised by the local Google Developer Group. I had the opportunity to organise an internal frontend conference inside my company for 100 people and I gave a talk as well there. I‚Äôm now sending more CFPs to International conferences to continue my speaking path.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like the feeling to contribution to the community. Sharing the knowledge I‚Äôve acquired over the years as a developer helps me improve my public speaking skills as well. Another thing that I love from conferences is networking and meeting new and amazingly interesting people from all over the world who share your interest and sometimes even hobbies.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I do remember my first talk. It was in the Vienna JS meetup, and I talked about a new library my team and I built at my current company. The idea was to share the library and promote it as open-source so anyone could use it. I was extremely nervous before going onto the stage, but the fact that my audience were developers too allowed me to relax a bit. At the end it went very well and smoothly. I got some very interesting questions after the talk and the people liked it.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJXzyHHh4pc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adri√°n Bolonio at ViennaJS</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve applied to around 15 international conferences so far. In the last 2 years I‚Äôve been accepted to 4 conferences and several meetups.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKYA-7tczuk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Adri√°n Bolonio on Accessibility at DevFest Vienna, 2018</em></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>At the beginning I was nervous and my only routine was trying to calm down. Now I‚Äôm a bit more experienced, so I check that my computer has enough battery or I have a charger that works. I check that all my other applications are closed and my notifications are muted. I check that the microphone works properly and the screen where the presentation is shown is readable from any point in the venue.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I think the best and more difficult advice is ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs ok to be a bit nervous, but try to understand that if you have been chosen to give a talk at a conference or at a local meetup it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre an expert in that field, so you know what you‚Äôre talking about. Just calm down, enjoy the talk, and accept any feedback.</p>\n<p>It needs to be fun for you, you don‚Äôt have to suffer, so please enjoy the process.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>Since I‚Äôm very focused now on Web Accessibility I follow a lot of experts, but some of them are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmatuzo\">Manuel Matuzovic</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_sergeikriger\">Sergei Kriger</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcysutton\">Marcy Sutton</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next speaker appearance in a conference will be at the <a href=\"https://jsconf.co/\">JSConf Colombia</a> on October 18th &#x26; 19th, 2019.

JC has some\ngreat tips for speakers - from both an organizer‚Äôs and speaker‚Äôs perspective.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9yzgNfr.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I work as Software Engineer at Growth Manager at <a href=\"https://echobind.com/\">Echobind</a>, a remote web and mobile consultancy for healthcare, life science, and technology companies (we‚Äôre hiring!) . On the side, I am also working on growing DevLifts, a company I started to help developers get fit.</p>\n<p>I got into public speaking through starting to speak at local meetups a few years ago, and then subsequently running 3 meetups and having a hard time finding speakers sometimes.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences because I get to share my ideas with a lot of people in a conversational (and more human) manner (as opposed to Twitter) and have those ideas put to the test. I also love getting to meet lots of new developers! Attending conferences is obviously a way to do that, but speaking can make it easier since people will want to come talk to you after your talk.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I actually just gave my first conference talk earlier this month! Going into it, I was a little nervous just because I was covering a fairly sensitive topic (fitness &#x26; health), but it went great. I got to meet a bunch of developers and hear about what they do to stay fit and healthy.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Until recently, I had applied to maybe 5-6 conferences and been rejected by all by 1. But in the past 2 months I got more aggressive with it and have applied to 30ish conferences. I‚Äôve been accepted by 3 so far.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>About 15 minutes before, I‚Äôll make sure to find the MC (or whoever is in charge of getting me to the right place for my talk) and checking in with them so they know where I am. I‚Äôll have a glass of water and go to the bathroom. Then I‚Äôll grab another glass of water to sip throughout the talk if necessary. I‚Äôll also turn my phone off and put it in my backpack or somewhere not on my person. Most importantly, I always make sure my notifications are muted!!!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> gave me some fantastic advice before my first conference talk. I was a bit nervous and he said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not nervous. You‚Äôre excited.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Nervousness is inward focused ‚Äî I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll screw up, I‚Äôm afraid something will go wrong, I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll hate my talk, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll start Twitter war.</p>\n<p>Being excited is outward focused ‚Äî I‚Äôm excited to give this talk to help others with this area of their lives. I‚Äôm doing this because I want to help other developers. If at least one person walks away feeling good/empowered/excited/etc., I‚Äôll be happy.</p>\n<p>As a conference organizer, I‚Äôll also say to new speakers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Show up early (at least an hour before your talk). This makes the organizers much less stressed if they know you are in the building because they‚Äôve seen you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure the MC can find you 15-20 minutes before your talk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Practice your talk. If you didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs obvious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be flexible. Organizing conferences is hard and usually being done for free as a labor of love. Being a diva because you can‚Äôt get a certain type of water will definitely get you on the <em>do-not-invite-back</em> list.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who‚Äôs inspired you?</h3>\n<p>So many, but here are a few:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GantLaborde\">Gant Laborde</a> is hands down the best speaker I know. I love being part of his audience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler\">Ken Wheeler</a> has the best combination of jokes and crazy good demos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dabit3\">Nader Dabit</a> got me into speaking because he‚Äôs one of the first people I saw give a tech talk at our local meetup years ago.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov\">Dan Abramov</a> because daaaaaang does that dude know how to keep a crowd engaged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/holtbt\">Brian Holt</a> because his talks have always been funny, mind-blowing, and approachable to me.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>My next scheduled conference talk is at <a href=\"https://connect.tech/\">Connect.tech</a> this October!
