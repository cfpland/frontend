At <a href=\"https://www.cfpland.com/\">CFP Land</a>, we\nhighlight different speakers every week in our Speaker’s Story blog posts.</em></p>\n<p>Tejas Kumar has dealt with haemophilia his whole life, but despite his disease preventing him from completing a traditional computer science education, he’s used his self-taught knowledge and communication skills to achieve success as a developer. Now, as a tech conference speaker, he’s giving back to other developers by passing on what he knows. Looking through Tejas’ social profiles, you’ll see that he doesn’t take himself too seriously, but his informal, casual tone is part of what makes him a unique and interesting speaker.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<p>I’m Tejas. I love people and code and the conversations we have together. I’ve been a public speaker since a young age. I grew up with a fatal sickness (that I still have) where I couldn’t do much and I often felt like I’d never amount to much, so in some ways, I guess I’ve been drawn to public speaking to overcompensate. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MdV43uT.png\" class=\"center\">\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I like encouraging the community. I often learn things and I enjoy disseminating the information from stages and then having conversations about it later. <strong>Truth be told, I enjoy the private conversations that happen after a good talk <em>a lot</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>While it has directly benefited my career with a number of job offers, visibility, Twitter followers, all kinds of glitz and glam, the real value I see from this type of engagement is the love. I get to share hope with people, combat impostor syndrome, and see careers flourish; life change from a stage. It’s all very encouraging.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I remember doing a TEDx talk like 7 years ago. It was really well received. I think there was even a standing ovation. It was fun. 🙂</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TUIcTl9Hto4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>Tejas presenting “Papercuts Can Kill” at TEDx</em></p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I think I’ve applied to like 20 and spoken at like 9? It’s a gut feeling though. I have no real idea.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I often put myself into the mindset of “I’ve won” already before I even play.</strong> This gives me hope and like prepares me to do an amazing job. Eventually, it somehow becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Odd, maybe, but it works for me every time.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>You’d be surprised by how much value you can add with a talk. Our tech industry today is so full of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TejasKumar_/status/1126096390281732097\">faux confidence and pretend knowledge</a> that one would often feel like they don’t know enough – I know I feel this way most of the time. The truth is, I actually know quite a bit <em>in my own, very specific area</em> that I can use to educate and help others who aren’t as familiar with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m often insecure about kubernetes, data structures and algorithms, and CS fundamentals because I personally was always too sick to get a Computer Science degree. I don’t have one. I am a prime example of impostor syndrome.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, I feel there are just as many people insecure about React, TypeScript, CSS and other areas. I rejoice at the idea of combating their impostor syndrome with my experience in these subjects. For me, this is part of the joy of public speaking along these themes.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been extremely uncomfortable with my <em>content</em> not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I’ve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason. As a result, I am trying to better my technical abilities to “close the loop”.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I’ve been inspired by a lot of speakers, inside and outside of tech circles. I especially appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mweststrate\">Michel Weststrate</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a>’s speaking styles as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarah_edo\">Sarah Drasner</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/darcar31\">Daria Caraway</a>.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I’m most active on twitter under <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tejaskumar_\">@tejaskumar_</a>.

I think our first conversation was awkward nods in the hotel gym way too early before the conference, but once that was over, we got to talk throughout the conference.</p>\n<p>In addition to speaking, Matt is an active open source maintainer, and has been giving back to the PHP community in various ways for the past several years. He also speaks on behalf of <a href=\"https://osmihelp.org/\">OSMI</a> - a great organization that helps raise awareness of mental health issues in the tech community - so I’m excited to present his journey into speaking and tips for those who are new to it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YjtivW4.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>During the day I’m a senior software engineer at a company called MoreCommerce where we do small and medium-sized business e-commerce and market place offerings. Outside of that, I help maintain various API related OSS projects like Fractal, openapi.tools, standards.rest and a few others. I spend most of my free time doing photography or cycling.</p>\n<p>As for speaking, I got my start at my old PHP user group in Atlanta. I started with a lightning talk and moved up to a full-length talk before breaking into a conference. Im usually pretty shy and quiet, so it was weird at first but it been a lot of fun.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>One of my favorite things about speaking is <strong>it’s an excuse to learn and play with new technology</strong>. I wouldn’t have become passionate about the OpenAPI spec if a conference hadn’t given me a chance to speak on it for example. And because my day job tends to focus more on boring tech that works, <strong>giving conference talks lets me experiment with stuff I know we wouldn’t touch at work.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>It feels so long ago, but my first talk was at a now-defunct conference called “Great Wide Open”. I submitted a talk essentially about why community is awesome and how it can help someone learn. Since it was my first talk I was incredibly nervous but somehow I pulled it off. I got good feedback for it, and felt like I could have massaged it a bit into a more full talk.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>This year I will have spoken at 5, including 2 (maybe 3) keynotes. That’s the most I’ve ever done. Last year I spoke at one conference.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p><strong>I usually put on some music, like Run The Jewels and just zone out.</strong> I tend not to sit in a talk before my slot so I can keep my thoughts going. Everyone is different, what works for me doesn’t mean it’ll work for someone else. I know some speakers will hide in their hotel room up until their talk, others just talk and socialize like its nothing. I’m also bad in that I will still be doing slides up until my talk. I should fix that.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>For your first talk, <strong>pick a topic you are passionate about but also already knowledgable about.</strong> Don’t experiment on new topics until you start getting accepted to speak. No need to add pressure on top of everything else.</p>\n<p>When you submit your CFP, check your spelling and grammar. It’s amazing how many people overlook it.</p>\n<p>Another thing is <strong>don’t immediately submit your abstract. Write it, and then talk a walk, get away from it, and come back after an hour and see how you feel about it. You may see things you can do better.</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, submit multiple submissions, it gives you better odds. When we organized <a href=\"https://twitter.com/southeastphp\">Southeast PHP</a>, people with multiple submissions had a better shot getting into our post-apocalyptic Thunderdome over someone who only gave us one thing to choose.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to?

I’m thrilled to bring you Drishti’s story today, and hope it inspires you to get out and do some good in the world!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w36pjbN.jpg?1\" class=\"left\">\n<p>Hi, I am Drishti Jain a Computer Engineer at heart and a technology enthusiast. I love to use technology to help the less fortunate. I am a social entrepreneur. I am the Co-founder and President of the non-profit organisation <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/samyakdrishtifoundation\">Samyak Drishti Foundation</a> which works in environment, education and healthcare sectors in 10 cities across India. I have been titled <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theoptimistcitizen/p/BdT0mVJnMhU/\">Eco-Warrior thrice by the Government of Maharashtra, India</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been a good orator since a young age. I got into public speaking at school in grade 4; when I had to give a speech on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti (for his birth anniversary). Ever since, I’ve loved the stage and sharing knowledge with all. Fun Fact: I also host music concerts sometimes :)</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>I love speaking at conferences about things that I am passionate about. While I continue to learn new things and develop myself, I like to share my learning with others. Speaking at conferences, I am sharing with everyone about how cool a technology is or how I make the most of a feature. It gives me immense satisfaction to share my knowledge with all.</p>\n<p>I have learnt a lot speaking at conferences. I would like to share my secret weapon to effectively speaking in front large audiences.</p>\n<p><strong>My secret weapon – the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause.</strong> These are three key parts of speaking effectively at conferences. Using this paradigm, I am able to more effectively deliver my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Moreover, speaking at conferences I am able to share my learning with all and give them a head start in the technology. I am believer of “Learning by sharing Knowledge” and speaking at conferences just fuels that!</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My first conference talk was an exciting experience. Post deciding my topic (after a lot of brainstorming) I realized that I had just entered the long hiking trail of preparing my talk, yet to embark. There was a mountain of information I had gathered through research on the topic. And I had to create my talk in a way that I would cover maximum information and make it interesting. <strong>It all seemed overwhelming at first; but I decide to sit and create a summary of the information, that made it easy to prepare my talk.</strong></p>\n<p>On the day of the conference, I reached the venue early and checked if my laptop was compatible with the system; it was all ok and I was set to present my talk. Having reached early, I got comfortable with the environment and eagerly waited for my talk slot.</p>\n<p>I gave my talk and had a good Q and A for my talk; which gave me the assurance and satisfaction that I presented well and attendees were listening keenly.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing experience!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>Considering events, workshops, tech talks, conferences I have spoken at about 30-40; including a few virtual speaking engagements.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I attend the talk before my talk to set into the energy of the conference hall. <strong>I also do a demo practice with a friend to gain feedback.</strong></p>\n<p>I feel enthusiastic over nervous before my talk. I believe I have learned to convert my nervous energy into enthusiasm by practicing before my talk. I know it can be difficult due to packed schedules of the conference and work; but I do make sure to make time to practice. Sometimes I skim through my talk contents or rehearse the complete talk depending on the time I can make in my schedule.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>I will encourage new speakers to speak about what they are truly passionate about. <strong>When you speak about something that you are passionate about; you will actually be pretty excited to speak instead of being nervous. And your energy will be reflected when you present.</strong> It will boost your confidence and you will enjoy speaking!</p>\n<p>If you feel crunching everything you love about the topic into the 30/45 min talk is getting on to you, <strong>go outside and have fresh air. It will help you have a clear head and invoke creativity in your talk.</strong> It is very trivial to know the audience you will be presenting for. Most importantly remember to be yourself and be excited to share with the world what you like about the technology.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I got inspired by the talk by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pranavmistry\">Pranav Mistry</a> on the Sixth-Sense technology. I liked how he presented the technology and included components in the talk that could be understood by someone new in the technology space. It has inspired me to include an overview of concepts related to my topic in the beginning of my talk for a couple of minutes, so that a participant novice to the topic understands the overall picture and doesn’t feel left out.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrtANPtnhyg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p><em>TEDIndia: The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology by Pranav Mistry</em></p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?</h3>\n<p>I am active on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drishtijjain\">@drishtijjain</a>.

What’s impressive to me is how quickly Kara has embraced her new career and been able to help others by giving talks at conferences and meetups. As Kara points out in this week’s Speaker’s Story, speaking is a great way to bolster your career and encourage others in the field.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into tech and eventually public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zFT1aBg.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>I had a weird path to tech. I pursued a career as a professional ballerina for a long time. I even moved to New York City by myself at 17 to train full-time with the Joffrey Ballet School. I really loved ballet but I realized that I’d be lucky if I could make my career last until I was 30 due to all of the strain it puts on your body.</p>\n<p>That’s when I decided to take a break from ballet, move back to my hometown of Nashville, TN, and go to college. I majored in public relations with a music business minor and was one of the lucky few to land a job in the music industry after I graduated.</p>\n<p>I absolutely loved working as a music publicist. It was a very glamorous job but also a highly stressful one and I was getting burnt out pretty quickly. I knew I needed a change and started looking into other career paths when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\">CodeCademy</a>. I really enjoyed the feeling of solving an error and decided that I wanted to make the leap to tech so I enrolled in The Iron Yard’s front end engineering bootcamp. Fast forward almost three years later and I’m still loving life in the tech world. I’m currently working as an engineer on the UX team at <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\">CrowdStrike</a>.</p>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p>Speaking at conferences has definitely benefited my career. It’s allowed me to expand my network in ways that I’ve never imagined before!</p>\n<p>I got into conference speaking first by writing blog posts which eventually led to speaking at local meetups and then conferences. I like that by speaking at conferences I can help others learn. <strong>It’s really cool that the way I present something or specifically explain something can help make whatever I’m talking about click with someone in a way that it hasn’t before.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>I gave my first conference talk not too long ago! Big shout out to CodeStock for allowing me the opportunity. I’m really happy with the way my talk turned out. I talk fast naturally and talk even faster when I’m nervous so I was worried that my 60-minute time slot would end up being closer to 20 minutes. I took my time and a couple deep breaths and managed to use up most of my allotted time though!</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’m still pretty new to the speaker circuit so I’ve only applied to around eight conferences. I’ve spoken at one so far and am currently on the waitlist for another. <strong>I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. I’m learning from each rejection I get.</strong></p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>I don’t like to attend a session before my talk as I like to take that time to be by myself and compose my thoughts. I’ll typically run through my slides one last time but I’ll only do a visual run through - I won’t actually practice. I also like to take a minute or two to go somewhere on my own and give myself a little pep talk!</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p><strong>Go for it! You can never succeed if you don’t try.</strong> Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and don’t give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>I really love watching Chloe Condon’s talks.

Like many speakers, George is an experienced software developer who’s passionate about mentoring and teaching newcomers to the field. In this week’s interview, hear more about how speaking at over 20 conferences so far has helped take George’s career to the next level.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h3>Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?</h3>\n<img src=\"https://georgemandis.s3.amazonaws.com/holyjs-piter-2017/me-holy-js.jpg\" class=\"right\">\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://george.mand.is/\">George Mandis</a>. I’m currently a full stack, independent web developer at <a href=\"https://snaptortoise.com/\">SnapTortoise</a> based out of Portland, Oregon, though I wear quite a few other hats. I’ve been freelancing for 13 years, but over the past 4 or 5 years I’ve gravitated towards mentorship roles. Teaching classes, workshops, leading bootcamps and working with junior developers one-on-one has been a rewarding experience and speaking feels like a natural extension to this.</p>\n<p>My first foray into speaking was actually at an Ignite event in Portland where I summarized, in 5 minutes, my experience <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2QC43jwPyM\">living as a digital nomad</a> for a year. I was terrified to speak in front of so many people, but it went well! After that I though I should look into conference speaking as a way to advance myself professionally, extend the aforementioned mentoring activities I mentioned and continue to travel and see the world, which is one my biggest passions.</p>\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2QC43jwPyM' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<h3>What do you like about speaking at conferences?</h3>\n<p><strong>Speaking at conferences is a really fun way to meet other developers and get outside perspectives on things — not just outside your particular industry, but outside your own country!</strong></p>\n<p>It’s always interesting to me to see one type of work or technology in-demand in one place and find it barely mentioned at all in another. It’s also nice to humanize other developers and put a face and a personality to a name. These conferences also have a tendency to be expensive and difficult to otherwise attend, as an independent developer. Being able to attend these conferences and pick the brain of people who work at some very large, influential tech companies is a wonderful opportunity.</p>\n<p>I think the process of preparing a talk and speaking in front of a large group people could benefit anyone’s career, but for mine it’s certainly opened some doors. <strong>Recently I joined the Google Developer Expert program, which is something that would have very likely not happened without my conference speaking.</strong></p>\n<p>The other benefit of speaking is I’ve found it’s a great opportunity to talk about the things you want to be doing, even if it’s not the thing you’re necessarily doing in your day-to-day. My talks tend to focus on creativity, art, hardware-dabbling and making interesting, outside-the-box projects through JavaScript. Speaking on these topics has allowed me to spend more time immersed in that world and meet other like-minded and very talented people with similar interests.</p>\n<h3>Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?</h3>\n<p>My very first “talk” was the 5-minute Ignite talk I mentioned earlier, but my first <em>technical</em> talk was at HolyJS in Russia. I remember applying to a number of conferences by that point in the year. Some had accepted me but had no budget for travel, but HolyJS was the first one where everything lined up.</p>\n<p>The idea of talking for a full hour was incredibly daunting — I’d never done that before! When I pulled up the conference website I became even more nervous — David Crockford and Lea Verou were two developers I’d read and followed for most of my career, and they were head-lining the conference! My attitude going in was, <strong>if this goes terribly, at least I’m 2000 miles from home and probably won’t ever run into any of these people again.</strong> It sounds funny, but it really took the pressure off!</p>\n<p>Fortunately it went well, and I’m happy to say I’ve seen several familiar faces from that conference at other conferences since then.</p>\n<h3>How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?</h3>\n<p>I’m not sure I could put a number on the number I’ve applied to. I’ve spoken at something around 20 now, but can guarantee you <strong>my acceptance rate is in the single digits, percentage-wise.</strong> Like most opportunities, it really is a numbers game. You have to be diligent and persistent, but also mindful of how you might be able to tweak your proposals to better suit a particular conference’s theme.</p>\n<h3>Do you have a pre-talk routine?</h3>\n<p>If I have time a day or two before the conference <strong>I like to walk to the venue from wherever I’m staying so that I’m not thinking too hard about finding it on the day I present.</strong> In the hours leading up to the presentation I practice saying key sentences and takeaways for specific slides as I go through the slide from beginning to end, over and over, and make sure all my demos work. Once it’s about 30-minutes or so to go I’ll put the slides away and just try to clear my head. This routine changes depending on how new the talk is and how comfortable I’m feeling with it.</p>\n<p><strong>I also try to see as many other talks as I can</strong>, though I that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming. After I’ve given my talk I’m much more relaxed and find it easier to enjoy the other talks. I try to make a point of shaking hands with all the speakers I see and letting them know I really appreciated what they spoke on. Other speakers might have differing opinions on that, but I know I genuinely appreciate it when someone in the audience comes up to me just to let me know they enjoyed my talk.</p>\n<h3>What advice do you have for new speakers?</h3>\n<p>When it comes to applying <strong>it really is a numbers game.</strong></p>\n<p>Apply early and often and try not to get too down on yourself if your talk isn’t accepted. For topics, there are many schools of thought on this, but I personally feel sharing a case study or story about how you used a particular piece of technology to achieve a specific goal is a good approach for giving your talk structure. Talking about why technology X is cool in general way can be just fine, but sharing how we used X at Y to achieve Z gives the audience something more concrete to walk away with.</p>\n<p>If you’re giving a workshop you can dive more deeply into the nitty-gritty workings of a thing and keep your focus there, but in a 20-40 minutes talk it’s more about introducing an idea and making the case for why others should have interest in it.</p>\n<h3>Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who’s inspired you?</h3>\n<p>There are quite a few, but I’ll mention two people I met at my very first talk who I think are wonderful: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaVerou\">Lea Verou</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/g33konaut\">Martin Splitt</a>. The list could be much longer, but I’ll stick with those for fear of omitting someone! I feel both of them have real passion for the web as an open platform and convey their enthusiasm and knowledge very well when they speak.</p>\n<h3>Where can readers find more about you?
