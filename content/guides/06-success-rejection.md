Speaking is a lot like applying for jobs in that most of the time, you're going to be rejected no matter how good you are. Knowing what to expect when you are accepted or rejected from a conference can help soften the blow, but it still hurts.

In this section, we'll cover some of the reasons your talk might have been rejected, what to do when you do get a talk accepted, and how to respectfully decline giving a talk when you can no longer commit to it.

## Handling Rejection

> Speaking is a numbers game. The great players in baseball only hit the ball 1/3 of the time at best. I find I only get accepted to every 1 out of 3 conferences I apply to. There’s a zillion reasons why your talk wasn’t accepted that has nothing to do with you:
>
> - Too similar to another already accepted
> - Too different to the other talks accepted
> - Technical, and they needed more non-technical content
> - Too advanced
> - Too geared towards beginners
> - All over the place
> - Too specific
> - Not the right fit for attendees
> - Your talk isn’t unique (gave at other conferences)
> - Your talk is too immature (haven’t given at any other conferences)

As you can see from the above list of reasons that speakers can be rejected by a conference, there is almost no way to get every talk accepted, and it's usually not a judgement on you or your ability or qualifications. Speakers are just overwhelmed with submissions and have to draw the lines somewhere. Many times that means you won't get chosen.

### What you'll hear when you're rejected

Unfortunately, many conferences don't even notify speakers when they're not chosen to speak. This means that you might not even know your talk was rejected until the conference releases its lineup. It's frustrating, but a reality to get used to before you get into speaking.

That said, it is really nice when the conference does take time to give you a rejection and feedback about why your talk wasn't chosen.

> I really appreciate when conferences give you feedback so you can apply that to the next one you submit to. I’m learning from each rejection I get.

### You're not alone

Once you realize you're not going to be speaking at this particular conference, take heart! You're not alone - most of the people who applied were not accepted. Even prolific speakers at tech conferences are rejected frequently:

> My CFP rejected-to-win ratio is probably around 0.00001 which is definitely an exercise in learning how to accept rejection and not take it personally.
> _[Rizwan Javaid](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-rizwan-javaid/)_

> You shouldn’t let the rejection emails get you down. I’ve spoken at conferences on three different continents, and I still regularly get rejected. Keep applying and refining your proposals.
> _[Anjuan Simmons](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/)_

It's especially tough for new speakers though as this kind of rejection is probably not something you're used to.

> It is usually difficult to get started as a conference speaker in terms of getting your CFP submissions accepted. This is totally okay and you don’t need to worry about it!
> _[Jaime Lopez](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/)_

The best thing you can do is learn from each rejection, and try again. There's no shortage of technology conference CFPs to apply for, so keep a positive attitude and keep trying.

> It’s like for pull requests: just as you’re not your code, you’re not your submissions. Accept probabilities are not in your favor, and face rejection with the same maturity.

### Improving for next time

If the conference doesn't give you a reason for your talk not being selected, you can email the organizers and ask them for feedback:

> Some conferences are happy to provide feedback when your session isn’t selected. Ask for it. It doesn’t hurt, and if they have time, they may respond. Some won’t though as they are often dealing with hundreds of sessions.
> _[Jono Bacon](https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/)_

In addition to asking for feedback, you can do your own sleuthing to find out how you could improve your talk for next year:

> Look at the talks that were accepted, what did they have in common with your proposal? What did they have that was different? Maybe you can ask some of the people who got talks accepted to share their details & pitch (things that are not put on the schedule).
> _[Richard Schneeman](https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal)_

Finally, you might get a discount to attend the conference just because you submitted. It might be worth going so you can meet some of the other speakers and organizers and learn what things will make your application stand out next year.

## Getting Accepted

If you submit CFPs long enough, you'll eventually get a talk accepted, and you'll be on your way to your first conference as a speaker. There are a few things to keep in mind

### Confirm or decline the invitation

- Be gracious, honest
- Suggest another speaker if you can
- Offer to help promote the conference on your social media anyway

### Note any logistical details they give you

- Will coordinate details

### Don't let imposter syndrome or nerves get you down

- "Imposter syndrome is real and a totally normal feeling, so do not let that hold you back. Especially early on, I always had a feeling of “everyone in the audience will already know what I’m talking about.” That is not the case. If they did, they would not be there. Those that show up want to hear YOU and learn from your experiences. If it turns out there are a few people that decide to leave during the talk for whatever reason, there is nothing wrong with that." - [John Riviello](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/)
- While you may not feel like the expert on this topic, the people listening to you came to hear YOU! Remember you’ve got friends in the audience — some you may know, and some you may not know…yet. - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-rhia-dixon/
- "I’ve always been extremely uncomfortable with my content not being technical enough because I often feel like I lack technical skill, but I’ve always been confident with the delivery because it seems to come naturally to me for whatever reason." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-tejas-kumar/
- "Feeling the pre-conference jitters is totally normal. I tell people all the time that if you don’t feel nervous before your talk, including the day of, you might want to go to the doctor. Indeed there is something wrong with your nervous system." - https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d

### Keep your expectations in check

- Conf may not actually happen
