## Finding CFPs

- CFP Land and other tools
  - "I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/
- Conference mailing list
- Social media (esp Twitter)
  - "Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/

### Which CFPs to submit to?

- "Start with local community events. They're easier to get to than major conferences and you'll get your first experiences as a public speaker in a more comfortable setting. Those kinds of events are often recorded, which is a valuable addition to your CFP." - https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp
- "It is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP)." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/
- "not all conferences are born equal: whether you like it or not, there’s a "coolness" factor attached to each of them." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/
- "You do NOT need to have the talk written before you write a proposal for that talk to apply to conferences with" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/
- Topic interesting to you?
  - "Maybe you can get your talk on web accessibility accepted at DjangoCon, but if you aren’t interested in Python, then the rest of the conference will be of minimal value to you." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0
- Is it a well-run conference?
  - First-time conf I was invited to speak at was cancelled a couple months before
  - "I recommend looking at videos from prior years and looking at the conference website, to see if it appears to be the work of conscientious, detail-oriented, experienced people." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0

## Questions to Ask
