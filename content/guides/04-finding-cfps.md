Once you're very well established as a technology conference speaker, you might start getting invited to speak, but for most speakers, this takes a long time if it happens at all. The reality is that conferences get many more speakers interested in speaking than they have slots, so they almost always hold an open "Call for Proposals" or CFP.

_For more detail on how conferences select speakers, check out [Section 3: How Conferences Choose Their Speakers](../how-conferences-choose/)_

Before you can submit any CFPs though, you'll need to find them. In this section, we'll look at various methods for finding conferences with open calls for proposals and selecting those that are worth your time.

## Finding CFPs

There are several ways that you can find open CFPs.

### 1. Contact the Conference Directly

### 2. Subscribe to the Conference's Newsletter

### 3. Use a CFP Aggregator

I'm biased towards this one - [that's why I started CFP Land]() - but it's also the most convenient method if you want to apply to speak at a lot of conferences. [CFP Land](https://www.cfpland.com/), [Confs.tech](https://confs.tech/), and [CallingAllPapers](https://callingallpapers.com/) are the most comprehensive CFP aggregators, and all three have access to similar datasets. At CFP Land, we add the perks that speakers can expect from the conference, but you could also look that information up yourself on each conference's website.

Any of these aggregators will have a list of open CFPs

- CFP Land and other tools
  - "I love that CFP Land lists which “perks” each conference offers (travel/hotel/stipend), if any. It means I don’t have to get all the way to have my paper accepted just to realize that I’m expected to fork over a couple of grand for the privilege of presenting." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/
- Conference mailing list
- Social media (esp Twitter)
  - "Another way to find conferences that’s worked for me is to literally search “tech cfp” on Twitter" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/

## Questions to Ask

- What perks? Sponsorship for paying my own way?

- Diversity in speaking?
- Speaker dinner?

- "Start with local community events. They're easier to get to than major conferences and you'll get your first experiences as a public speaker in a more comfortable setting. Those kinds of events are often recorded, which is a valuable addition to your CFP." - https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp
- "It is better to submit to many conferences that you think would benefit from your talk than it is to be fixated on any particular conference (which puts all of your hopes and dreams on a single CFP)." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/
- "not all conferences are born equal: whether you like it or not, there’s a "coolness" factor attached to each of them." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/
- "You do NOT need to have the talk written before you write a proposal for that talk to apply to conferences with" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/
- Topic interesting to you?
  - "Maybe you can get your talk on web accessibility accepted at DjangoCon, but if you aren’t interested in Python, then the rest of the conference will be of minimal value to you." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0
- Is it a well-run conference?
  - First-time conf I was invited to speak at was cancelled a couple months before
  - "I recommend looking at videos from prior years and looking at the conference website, to see if it appears to be the work of conscientious, detail-oriented, experienced people." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0
