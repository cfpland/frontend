## Preparing for the conf

- Permission from your employer
- Flight/hotel/dates
  - "reach an agreement with the organizers on what level of reimbursement they’ll provide before you accept their offer. This is more important with international travel." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0
  - "if you’re going to combine the conference trip with vacation, I highly recommend doing the vacation after the conference, so you’re not stressed about your talk the whole time." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0
- Conf schedule - where do you fit? What other talks do you want to see?
  - "I also try to see as many other talks as I can, though I that can be difficult sometimes when my nerves are racing and my talk is still looming." - [George Mandis](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-george-mandis/)
- Airport to venue transportation
- Attendee or speaker Slack?
- Appropriate clothing, haircut
- Twitter hashtag
- Read about the conf, audience, and speaker handbook:
  - "Most conference organizers will create a speaker brief or handbook to convey all the key information to you about the event. They’ll cover things like who the audience is, the overall event theme, and the agreed title and content of your talk." - https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/
- Prepare
  - "My current routine starts with preparing my mind, about a week before I am due to give my talk. I start by booking a conference room in my office for an hour each workday morning. I use this time to practice my session out loud." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/
- What kind of microphone will they have?
- Clicker or pointer?
  - Conference may provide it, may not.
- Equipment/adapters
  - "Display is not the only point to take into account. If you’re travelling in other countries, power plugs need to be taken care of as well. European countries are mostly compatible with one another, but watch out if you come to Northern America or UK." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/
- Wifi?
  - "If your presentation requires network access, it’s your responsibility to make sure the Wifi will be good enough on-site. For that, I usually ask if there will be a Wifi network dedicated for speakers: I don’t have confidence in a shared one." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/
- Media?
  - "if you have any kind of interactivity or rich media in your presentation, you absolutely have to run through it with the organizer onsite before you go on stage." - https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/
- Room?
  - "You should also figure out what room you’ll be speaking in — are you in the keynote slot, or in a tiny side-room? Will your talk be recorded? Some conferences only record certain tracks."

## Day of

- Arrive at your session early
- Get pumped up:
  - "I have a Presentation Pre-Pump Playlist in Google Music on my phone that I listen to right before I step on stage. The contents of the playlist is classified."
