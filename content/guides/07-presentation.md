## Presentation

- Know your audience
  - "Learn the approximate proficiency of your target audience before giving a talk. Make it easier to beginners (usually) or harder (on particular events) if needed. I mismatched several times, and it’s not the best thing to do." - https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd
- Know your topic
- Practice (lunch & learn, Meetup, record)
- Text vs images - "People can either listen to you or read your slides. They won't do both."
  - "Your slides only really serve three good purposes: entertainment, illustration, and roadmap. Anything else is distracting your audience from listening to you." - https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67
- Stories vs information
  - "Stories, metaphors, examples, jokes, pictures, videos and other props are all excellent ways to keep things interesting, but make sure that they clearly relate to your core takeaways." - https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/
- Cover slide?
  - "I always set the conference logo on the cover slide. The people behind the conference have put a lot of effort into the organization, it’s only fair play to promote their brand by doing so. Plus, they generally provide logos, so it’s a no-brainer." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/
- Last slide
  - Contact/follow up information
  - Link to slides or more info
  - Probably up during Q&A
- Format: Hero's Journey
  - "they learn that hey, this is hard, and it’s ok to struggle. This person, who must be smart because they’re up there on the stage, makes mistakes. I make mistakes too, so we’re kind of similar. They conquered their problem, so maybe I can conquer mine." - http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks
- Format: Deep Dive
  - "One of my favorite forms is the deep dive. This is what I might call the Pat Shaughnessy talk. It’s been a long time since I studied undergrad Computer Science, and I didn’t understand a lot of it the first time around." - http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks
- Format: R&D/Science Projects
  - "These talks focus on something that’s cool but that not many engineers get to work with on a day to day basis. I’ve given a talk like this about procedural content generation, for instance." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0
- Format: Solution to common problem
  - "when a new framework becomes popular, there’s often a variety of opinions about the best way to do automated testing for code that uses it. Even if your solution isn’t the best, it can become a standard if you’re the first with a conference video." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0
- Humor? Edginess?
- "keep politics and religion out of your sessions. Also, avoid sexualized imagery, and try not to be an asshole about other people to make a point." - https://www.jonobacon.com/2019/01/21/get-your-cfp-session-picked/
- Enthusiasm
  - "Enjoy being on the stage and sharing your learnings and experience. Smile! Tell a joke. Be human, and you’ll notice the audience respond to you." - https://blog.prezi.com/speaking-at-a-conference-here-are-10-things-the-organizer-wants-you-to-keep-in-mind/

### Live demos

- "Have backups. If your demo breaks on stage, revert to showing the video of the same thing in action." - https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp
