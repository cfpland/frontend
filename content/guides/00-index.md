While running CFP Land I've had the opportunity to [meet with and learn from dozens of speakers around the world](/blog/). The community has been amazingly welcoming and helpful, so I wanted to give some of this knowledge back by releasing a comprehensive guide to speaking at technology conferences.

Because everyone reading this will start at a different level of speaking experience, you can either jump straight to the section you find most relevant using the Table of Contents below or read all the sections sequentially by looking for the "Next" link at the bottom of each page.

## About This Guide

Whether you're preparing for your first speaking engagement, speaking at your 100th event, or not sure how to even get started, this guide will get you on the right track. <strong>I've compiled advice from over 30 interviews I've done with conference speakers, dozens of blog posts I read, and my own experience as a speaker to create this comprehensive guide to speaking at technology conferences.</strong>

As you read through these chapters, you may have your own ideas or resources to suggest. That's great! I'd love to continue refining and building this guide with help from the community. Just [shoot me an email](mailto:info@cfpland.com) with the tips you'd like to add, and I'll keep updating this resource.

Also, be sure to check out the [dozens of open CFPs listed on CFP Land right now](/conferences/). If you don't want to miss any in the future, be sure to also sign up for our mailing list below.
