# 23 Technology Conferences that Pay Speakers to Attend

Does the thrill of speaking at a conference exhilarate you all on its own? Sharing your knowledge with others and watching the lightbulb turn on inside the heads of your audience members can certainly give you a rush - I know it does that to me. But, what if there was more in it than just the internal gratification and new connections? What if you were also financially compensated for sharing your gifts? What if you even got a free trip? If this seems too good to be true, don’t worry, it’s not!

There are actually many technology conferences that pay speakers to attend, and you don’t have to be Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerburg to land a paid speaking gig. As long as you have a good idea, a great story, or something new to share, you can be paid to spread your knowledge.

Here are 23 technology conferences that routinely compensate speakers and/or cover their travel costs. Keep an eye out for new speaking opportunities as they emerge [here](https://www.cfpland.com/conferences/), too.
