I compiled advice from over a hundred speakers while writing [the Comprehensive Guide to Speaking at Technology Conferences](/guides/speaking/), but not every quote I found was right for that guide. Some were controversial, overlapping, or opinionated, and I wanted the guide to be a more universal walkthrough for conference speakers.

Still, many of the tips, observations, and suggestions that weren't right for the guide were still worth publishing, so I've compiled over 100 of those tips here in this blog post.  

## Beginner Tips

- Nervousness
  - "I was that girl who was so nervous I felt sick when I had to answer a question in class in front of people in high school. I was so shy and scared of public speaking. I never, ever thought I’d be speaking at conferences one day." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/
  - "I don’t think I slept for three days before my first talk. One of the reasons I enjoy giving talks is that I get to work on my fear of speaking in front of crowds. That said, I always struggle right before I actually get on stage." - [Joe Mastey](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-joe-mastey/)
  - "the intense rush of adrenaline and nerves before you get on stage is COMPLETELY NORMAL and it happens to everyone, even people who’ve been doing it for years." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/
- Fake it:
  - "If anyone asks me about how I’m feeling I tell them “excited!” Even if I’m actually totally nervous, I find that embodying excitement helps me feel that way." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/
  - "You were chosen for a reason. Trust that.

Most people in the audience would be terrified to do what you’re doing, and they respect that.

Memorize the first 2 minutes of your talk cold, because it’s easier once you get rolling." - https://twitter.com/wiredferret

- Do more speaking in other venues:
  - "I’d definitely recommend panels as a gateway experience for anyone who is considering branching out into public speaking." - [Laura Janusek](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/)
- Practice:
  - "“practice”. No one did great the first time they got on stage or the second one, but practice makes perfect. So look at your presentations, identify the areas you could have done better (be it slides, content, posture, delivery), and then find the next conference or meetup where you can practice your talk some more and improve on those points." - [Alex Lakatos](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/)
- Be ready early
  - "I always try to attend the talk before mine in the same room, just so I can start setting up and doing a final check of everything as soon as the last presenter is done with their talk." - [Keanan Koppenhaver](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-keanan-koppenhaver/)
- "I personally think it’s better to shorten one’s talk in order to receive questions, than to deliver everything and have no time for them. However, note that is very dependent on conference country’s culture." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/

- "double the speakers means double the cost. To be transparent, we do hold applications with multiple speakers to a higher standard during our evaluation." - https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260

> You can be introverted, awkward, and socially anxious, and still be a great conference speaker and get a ton of benefit from doing it.
> _[Eva PenzyMoog](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/)_

> "Before you submit a proposal on a topic, consider writing a blog post about it. If you were able to say everything you wanted to in 1 post, then it’s probably not a good candidate for a talk. Written words work well for reference and getting started, materials, and for comprehensive rundowns. Talks on the other hand favor emotional communication. What is the story behind this refactoring? Are you taking a boring topic and making it interesting or memorable somehow in a way that only a live performance could do justice to?" - https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal

> "Instead of simply stating opinions or facts (e.g. “React is the most popular JavaScript library”) as well as revealing all of your cards instantaneously, tell a story." - https://medium.com/@fox/how-to-write-a-successful-conference-proposal-4461509d3e32

## Advanced Tips

- Pumping up
  - "Start with local community events. They're easier to get to than major conferences and you'll get your first experiences as a public speaker in a more comfortable setting. Those kinds of events are often recorded, which is a valuable addition to your CFP." - https://dev.to/tlakomy/what-i-wished-someone-told-me-about-speaking-at-tech-conferences-3opp
  - "I usually find a quiet spot in the speakers room, or in the bathroom (I want to apologize to anyone who has heard my pre-talk routine), and I start imagining I just won (dunno what, but the point is I’m a winner now!): pump my chest forward, straighten my shoulders, raise my fist in the air, grin widely, maybe even shout a few “Hell yeah!“s if I think the toilet it empty (spoiler alert: it rarely is as empty as I think). That makes me think I just won something, I don’t need to win on stage as well, and it calms my nerves enough so I don’t shake as I speak." - [Alex Lakatos](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-alex-lakatos/)
- Gather feedback
- Record Yourself
- Keep an open mind
  - "I think it’s a shame when speakers come in just for their session and then leave. I make it a point to support and learn from the other speakers when I’m at a conference, so my session is usually one of many that I participate in throughout the day." - [Laura Janusek](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/)
- "1. Great delivery gets good ratings, but great content has more impact. Remove everything that's not content.

2. Explain it the way you would explain it to a friend in a bar with a napkin.
3. Slides constrain you. They are crutches. Do it without, then add a few if necessary." - https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes

- Questions or no questions?
  - "Don't feel like you need to take questions at the end of your talk either. Some people are comfortable w/ it. Others aren't. Totally cool if you decide to just end it without questions." - https://twitter.com/byronwoodfork

> Wear comfortable shoes to present in, and wear them while practicing, so you build the postural memory.
> Eat 1 hour before, pee 15 minutes before you’re scheduled.
> Practice out loud, to get used to hearing your voice, and to manage any tongue twisters before hand.
> https://twitter.com/CZEdwards

> If doing demos, have a video of them, just in case (conf wifi sucks!)

> I generally try not to memorize my talks because it causes me to become robotic when speaking. Instead, I walk through the main points (generally a single word) that I want to mention related to my slides or code that I’m sharing.
> [Jaime Lopez](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-jaime-lopez-jr/)

- "make sure you start off smiling 😃" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/

- "During the intro of your talk, let the audience know how you intend to take questions (raise your hand during the talk, hold them until the end, chat in the hallway later, email, etc.). If someone asks a question that you don’t know the answer to, it is much better to say “That is a great question. I don’t know what the answer is so let me get back to you,” than to try to make up an answer on the spot." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-john-riviello/

- "Watch technical conference talks, and also watch talks in other fields like TED that are captivating. What makes them good?" - https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal

- "When you are stressed, you’ll probably talk faster than intended, and even skip some parts of your talk. Hence, you should plan for that, and plan for more content than the expected talk duration." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/

- "there always is a handful of people who are nodding or smiling during your talk. Try to focus on them specifically, as this brings you positive reinforcement, and help you stay "in the zone"." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/

- "Just because the allocated time slot has been passed doesn’t mean you’re done. You should stay in the room for a little while, to allow people who had no time to ask their questions - or those who were to shy - to come to talk with you. Just be considerate to the next speaker and remove your stuff so he can start preparing his set: nothing is worse than a speaker that continues monopolizing the stage after his allotted timeframe." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/

- "Some jokes that send the whole audience to laughter in some countries could likely be considered inappropriate - or even offensive - in others. If you’re not sure whether a specific comment/joke is appropriate for your audience, just don’t try." - https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/

- "Go for it! You can never succeed if you don’t try. Submit to conferences that seems interesting to you and don’t give up on trying again if one tells you no. Even the most experienced speakers get rejections." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-kara-luton/

- "My secret weapon – the 3 P paradigm: Pace, Pitch, Pause." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-drishti-jain/

- "I joined Toastmasters, met cooler people, and with a lot of time and energy, now people can’t shut me up. It’s always a pleasure to help my fellow speakers and aspiring speakers. The journey wasn’t comfortable, but it’s doable." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/
- "Think more about your audience than yourself" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/
- "Realize the audience wants you to succeed, and they can’t see that you’re nervous unless you tell them." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/
- "They will feel what you feel. So 😃 (smile)" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-gant-laborde/

- "the more I apply and the more I speak, the more conferences are approaching me instead of the other way around and that’s a really nice feeling." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/

- "If you’re brand new, it might be hard to find speaking gigs that will cover your travel and accommodations...Take a few of these gigs if you need to so you can get started and get your name out there, but as soon as someone offers to cover your travel/accommodations, demand it every time you speak afterward." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-bailey-lewis/

- "practice, practice, practice and practice out loud! You will not get a feel for your talk by practicing it “in your head”." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/
- "do not be the person that edits your presentation hours/minutes leading up to your talk. Doing so means you are going to have to figure out what you want say while presenting." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/

- "mistakes will happen and when they do move on. I’ve seen some technical talks derailed because the presenter spent too long trying to get a code example to work, or wait for a file to load due to a bad internet connection. If something is not going correct, move on to the next part of your talk, your audience will thank you." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-mike-miles/

- "make your talk interactive. Find ways to get your audience engaged with your message through exercises, questions, or discussions. Getting the audience involved will help them connect with your message on a deeper level" - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-rizwan-javaid/

- "as someone who gets a lot of stage fright, the only thing that helps is just doing it a bunch." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-eva-penzeymoog/

- "these are regular people who are rooting for you. And the biggest step is to just be there." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-taelur-alexis/

- "Make sure the MC can find you 15-20 minutes before your talk." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-jc-hiatt/

- "Be flexible. Organizing conferences is hard and usually being done for free as a labor of love. Being a diva because you can’t get a certain type of water will definitely get you on the do-not-invite-back list." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-jc-hiatt/

- "It’s ok to be a bit nervous, but try to understand that if you have been chosen to give a talk at a conference or at a local meetup it’s because you’re an expert in that field, so you know what you’re talking about." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-adrian-bolonio/

- "if you’re a new speaker, you probably are more experienced than you realize if your job requires you to do a lot of communication (even if it’s just in small team meetings or Slack conversations)." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/

- "I think to get less represented people on stage, we really need to just ask them more. It’s hard to imagine yourself on stage if you’ve never really seen someone like you doing it." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-nicola-rushton/

- "even people who are experts need reminders best practices and first principles. So, don’t count yourself out just because you think you’re not an expert." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/

- "You don’t have to memorize everything you’re going to say, but you need to have a solid idea of the journey you’re taking the audience on in your talk." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-anjuan-simmons/

- "Try to make your talk a story worth telling - people always want to hear real-life stories about how others have dealt with common challenges." - https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speaker-itai-yaffe/
- "When you read a list few will remember anything. When you tell a story most will remember the whole thing. Don’t waste the audience’s time." - http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks
- "Programmers are accustomed to a bit of bravado, but you can’t take it too far. One of the clear ways to go wrong is to talk bad about another project." - http://jumpstartlab.com/news/archives/2014/02/15/prototypical-conference-talks

- " Keep it simple: focus on one topic with clear examples" - https://twitter.com/johnsundell/status/976496157928165378?s=19

- "When I first started speaking, I leaned on the talks where I’d have to do more learning to present, because I was more junior in my career and didn’t have as much I could speak on. Now that I’ve seen a few more things, I’m able to produce talks that are closer to my day-job experience." - https://hackernoon.com/how-and-why-to-speak-at-tech-conferences-1d50a3f548e0

- "Stories of failure feel way more honest than success stories. From many conversations feels like a description of mistakes yields more value than success stories. Problem — Efforts — Solution is the best format." - https://medium.com/@tryshchenko/why-am-i-doing-public-speaking-at-tech-events-the-honest-answer-a75d80f85cfd

- "Avoid eating before your talk. Trust me on this. If you have a wonky digestive system, waiting until your talk is over is the best bet, or eating something VERY light is the option to go with." - https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d
- "Make sure you have water on hand. Prep the podium you will be speaking at with a couple cups of water or a couple bottles of water." - https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d
- "Carbonated drinks give you gas and then you burp during your talk, if you are mic’ed up, that is no good. Stay away from carbonation until after your talk." - https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d
- "Do your best not to use filler words like “uh”, and “um”." - https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d
- "Use the area you have between the wall and screen to move. If you move it keeps the eyes of the audience moving, therefore they are engaged." - https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d

- "Whenever you say the name of a product the first time, make sure you say it very clearly, especially if the audience’s first language is not the same as the language you are giving your talk in." - https://medium.com/@shehackspurple/presentation-tips-for-technical-talks-8d59f3de9f6d
- "Always explain what every acronym means the first time you use it. If it is a core component of your talk, if it’s not too clumsy, say the full name of it twice or even three times, throughout the talk." - https://medium.com/@shehackspurple/presentation-tips-for-technical-talks-8d59f3de9f6d

- "Take a breath in-between each major point — so the audience has time to digest the info, and so that you can breathe." - https://medium.com/@shehackspurple/presentation-tips-for-technical-talks-8d59f3de9f6d
- "Unless your talk is “an intro to xyz” or level 101, don’t spend more than 10 minutes of your talk giving background on the topic." - https://medium.com/@shehackspurple/presentation-tips-for-technical-talks-8d59f3de9f6d
- "give a rough outline of your talk right at the start, then the audience knows what to expect." - https://medium.com/@shehackspurple/presentation-tips-for-technical-talks-8d59f3de9f6d

- "Take a close look at the track you’re applying to speak at and think about who the target audience is." - https://medium.com/uxrblog/uxrconf-2020-a-few-tips-for-crafting-a-great-speaker-application-b295e3f61260

- "Imagine speaking to one audience member at a time when you’re up on stage and you’ll find that it’s easier trying to connect to one person at a time than a whole room." - https://www.lifehack.org/688597/the-ultimate-public-speaking-tips
- "Hand gesturing is a great way to avoid looking stiff and awkward on stage. A key tip is to have your hands held high above your waist at all times and let your hands gesture naturally as you talk." - https://www.lifehack.org/688597/the-ultimate-public-speaking-tips
- "Standing tall and with good posture can do wonders for your perceived confidence and your actual performance." - https://www.lifehack.org/688597/the-ultimate-public-speaking-tips

- "writing a session proposal is just like marketing. If that makes you feel dirty, you won't get many sessions accepted." - https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/3-paragraph-pitch

- "Since I know I like to improvise a little to keep my speech from feeling stiff, I will plan creating content that fills 75% of the available time." - https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67
- "There’s a myth that public speaking equals teaching. Wrong job. Public speaking is entertainment." - https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67

- "Some fabrics show wetness remarkably well. Grey cotton t-shirts are a cruel trap for the unsuspecting!" - https://hackernoon.com/dressing-for-the-stage-theatre-rules-apply-90a29614ad67

* "Feeling the pre-conference jitters is totally normal. I tell people all the time that if you don’t feel nervous before your talk, including the day of, you might want to go to the doctor. Indeed there is something wrong with your nervous system." - https://medium.com/@saltnburnem/speaker-tips-legit-feels-b17b30a464d

## Talk title

- "Try to use descriptive words or action statements in the title." - https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal
- "Don’t alienate your audience through jargon. Your title should say something about your talk. If it’s an “in” joke or an acronym don’t use it." - https://schneems.com/blogs/2016-04-07-conference-proposal
