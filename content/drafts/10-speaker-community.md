## Engaging with the speaker community

> "I’ve been incredibly fortunate to get to meet and become friends with some of my heroes in the industry as a result of speaking at conferences. That’s probably the biggest benefit for me." - [Joe Mastey](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-joe-mastey/)

> "Speaking establishes your authority in your subject area, and it gives you the chance to genuinely help people learn something new. This teaching aspect is especially important to me." - [Laura Janusek](https://www.cfpland.com/blog/speakers-story-laura-janusek/)
