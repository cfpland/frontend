### Tell me about yourself. How did you get into public speaking?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tChR2X7.png" class="left" />

Other than being married to Liron and a father to Yaara and Yuval, I‚Äôm also working at Nielsen, the data and measurement company. I work for a division called Nielsen Marketing Cloud, as the tech lead of the big data group (sometimes people confuse ‚Äútech lead‚Äù with ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù, so I wrote a [short post](https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/tech-lead-dont-you-mean-team-lead-c8bde92e38ab) to explain what I see as a tech lead üòÉ).

In addition to that, I‚Äôm also a co-founder and a core team member of the Israeli chapter of [Women in Big Data](https://www.womeninbigdata.org/).

I actually got into public speaking more than 10 years ago, when I was invited to give a talk about Mainframes to a group of young soldiers during their basic programming course in the army. I really enjoyed it, and since then I‚Äôve had the chance to talk about various topics in several different forums, ranging from internal sessions, through local meetups, all the way to international conferences.

### What do you like about speaking at conferences?

While speaking at conferences is not part of my job per se, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs beneficial for my career in the long run, but that‚Äôs definitely not the main reason for me to do it. The main reason is actually the fact that it gives me an opportunity to meet a lot of smart people and share my knowledge with them - I absolutely love it!

There are two added bonuses for speaking at conferences:

1. I get to attend other talks and learn from others as well.
2. After I give a talk, people come up to me and ask questions, which always leads to very interesting conversations.

Bottom line - speaking at conferences is an awesome experience.

### What topics do you typically speak about?

In the last 7 years or so, I‚Äôve been a big data developer and tech lead, so naturally I cover big data related topics, usually frameworks and tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Kafka and Apache Druid.

I‚Äôve worked on data-centric systems since the early days of my career, and it‚Äôs funny how sometimes the terminology is similar, while the underlying technology has significantly evolved (e.g Mainframe batch jobs vs a Spark batch jobs). As a data engineer, it‚Äôs exciting to be able to use cutting-edge tools to process the ever-increasing amounts of data, and so is the opportunity to share with others how we actually use those tools.

### Do you remember your first conference talk? How did it go?

Yes, I definitely remember that talk! It was a local conference about 2.5 years ago, where my colleague, Yakir Buskilla (who‚Äôs now our VP R&D), and I spoke about how we use Druid for interactive count-distinct queries at scale.

It was the first time I gave a talk to such a large audience (about 400 people), and I was excited (and a bit nervous of course‚Ä¶). We got great feedback after the talk, so I guess you can say it went well.

You can check out the video recording of that talk below (my part starts at 12:01 minutes):

### How many conferences have you applied to and spoken at?

Since I joined Nielsen, over 5 years ago, I applied to around 10 conferences, and was accepted to about 7 of them. 2019 has been extremely successful for me as a speaker, presenting and co-presenting at 5 different conferences throughout the year. I also speak at meetups and other forums quite often.

And, I‚Äôve already started working on my applications for next year‚Äôs conferences.

### Do you have a pre-talk routine?

I arrive a few minutes earlier to the location I‚Äôm going to talk at, and make sure everything is set-up properly. I also keep a bottle of water close by (just in case). Last but not least, it‚Äôs always helpful to pick a positive thought or idea that can lift your spirit and energize you right before getting on stage. I sometimes use [Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Me Now‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM) (apparently, this is even [backed by a scientific study](https://loudwire.com/queen-dont-stop-me-now-worlds-most-uplifting-song/)).

### What advice do you have for new speakers?

The best advice I can give, is to[read my blog post about [How to present at meetups and survive (and what does Freddie Mercury have to do with it?)](https://medium.com/nmc-techblog/how-to-present-at-meetups-and-survive-and-what-does-freddie-mercury-have-to-do-with-it-614b22a7fa9b) üòÉ

But to summarize the tips from that post:

- Success doesn‚Äôt (usually) happen overnight, it takes a lot of work.
- Try to make your talk a story worth telling - people always want to hear real-life stories about how others have dealt with common challenges.
- Practice makes perfect - conduct a lot of dry-runs and get early feedback.
- Don‚Äôt let criticism get you down.
- Don‚Äôt let yourself get you down.
- Don‚Äôt forget to enjoy!

### Are there any other speakers you look up to? Anyone who's inspired you?

I‚Äôve been to several conferences and seen many great speakers, but I really look up to [Holden Karau](https://twitter.com/holdenkarau) - her talks are always awesome, funny and insightful!

She‚Äôs involved in quite a few open-source projects, and it‚Äôs really impressive she‚Äôs able to contribute to the open-source community both in terms of coding and in terms of sharing her knowledge.

### Where can readers find more about you?

I‚Äôd love to meet you at [Spark+AI Summit Europe](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/europe) on October 15-17 in Amsterdam, where I‚Äôll be talking about [different streaming methods with Spark and Kafka](https://databricks.com/session_eu19/stream-stream-stream-different-streaming-methods-with-apache-spark-and-kafka). Or, if you prefer London, you can join me at [Big Data LDN](https://bigdataldn.com) on November 13-14, where my VP R&D and I will be talking about [how we use Druid for counting unique users in real-time](https://bigdataldn.com/seminar-schedule/counting-unique-users-in-real-time-heres-a-challenge-for-you/).

If you happen to be based in Israel, you‚Äôre more than welcome to join our [R&D‚Äôs meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/The-Big-Web-Theory/) and [the Israeli chapter of Women in Big Data meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Big-Data-Israel/) (which is open to everyone, regardless of gender!).

And last but not least, I invite you to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itaiy/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ItaiYaffe) or follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@itai.yaffe).
