_TL;DR: Back in 2017, I made a personal goal to get accepted to speak at 4
conferences. [I made
it](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary) üéâ and used
the experience to launch [CFP Land, a free tool to help conference speakers
keep up with CFPs (Calls for Proposals](https://www.cfpland.com/)) üì£_

In 2017, I set myself a goal to **get accepted to speak at 4 technical
conferences.**

I‚Äôm a big goals person ‚Äî every month I reassess my list of personal goals,
record my progress, and make adjustments as necessary ‚Äî so when I set out to do
something, I _usually_ figure out a way to make it happen.

I had done enough presenting, teaching, singing and acting in my life to feel
pretty comfortable on a stage, but I had never tried to break into the tech
conference scene. Like many software developers, **I felt that I didn‚Äôt really
have that much to talk about, that my experience was not unique, and that
someone in the audience would call me out for being a fraud.**

### Overcoming the Fear

Grappling with the fear of inadequacy is a lifelong pursuit for many of us. I‚Äôm
fortunate to not be crippled by it, but it still took me years to put myself out
there and give a technical talk.

The way I overcame this fear was to **start small**. As I came up with talk
ideas I pitched them to local meetups and code bootcamps. After giving some of
these talks, I realized that the audience isn‚Äôt as scary as I thought. _These
are just other developers who genuinely want to learn something, and I‚Äôm lucky
enough to be helping them!_

### Setting the Goal

Four conferences was arbitrary. It felt like enough that I would be able to call
myself a ‚Äúreal‚Äù conference speaker, but not so many that I would have to travel
all the time. I love traveling, but with a wife and puppy at home, I have
practical limits.

So, I settled on four, and started forming a plan for making it happen.

### Making a Plan

When I create a personal goal, I don‚Äôt just write it down and check on it. The
important part to goal-setting is making measurable milestones that you believe
will help you achieve that goal. In this case, I started by making a sub-goal:

#### Sub-Goal: Get Accepted to Speak at One Conference

- ‚úÖ Write 2 conference talk proposals
- ‚úÖ Create slides for the proposed talks
- ‚úÖ Find 40+ conference CFPs
- ‚úÖ Submit 2 proposals to 3+ conferences per week until I get accepted

As I worked my way through the checklist (it probably took about 12 weeks in
all), I learned a lot about how to write a good proposal and what conferences
usually looked for. I was very careful to read the conference‚Äôs CFP page, but
I‚Äôll admit that I sometimes submitted proposals that weren‚Äôt an ideal fit
anyway.

Within a few weeks, [I had gotten my first
acceptance](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/api-strat-2017-presentation)! Now
I knew what it would take to get a talk accepted, and I felt like I had some
momentum.

### Oh Yeah, I Still Have to Prepare

With one conference booked, I started refining and practicing my proposed talk.
The very first time I went through the slides it took me 25 minutes‚Ä¶for a 45
minute speaking slot‚Ä¶whoops!

This is where the meetups came in. After I had practiced about 12 times on my
own, I gave my talk to the local [Chicago Javascript
meetup](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers-js-chicago). I
practiced solo several more times before giving it at the conference.

But while I was preparing, I was surprised to see acceptances continue rolling
in. I ended up getting 7 accepts in the first few months of pitching my talk.

### It Doesn‚Äôt Always Work Out

I was excited, but started to run into some tough decisions. One conference in
Romania was the same weekend as a family obligation and two conferences were on
the exact same day, so I turned down the second one that accepted me. In another
unexpected turn, one conference couldn‚Äôt get the attendance they needed, so it
was cancelled outright.

That took my total for 2017/2018 down to four. A manageable number, and even
better, I had hit my goal for the year! üéâ

### The takeaway: CFPs seem hard, but they don‚Äôt have to be

[I learned a lot in that first year
speaking](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary), and
while I‚Äôve dialed back the number of applications I submit, I‚Äôm still actively
engaged in the speaking community, and submitting a few CFPs per month.

The whole experience has showed me that speaking isn‚Äôt as scary as it seems, and
submitting winning CFPs isn‚Äôt a black art. It inspired me to create something
that would help other speakers ‚Äî new and experienced ‚Äî improve their odds of
success and become better, more prolific speakers, and thus [CFP Land was
born](https://www.cfpland.com/).

### CFP Land: Never Miss a Call for Proposals Again

**One of the most frustrating things for me was when I‚Äôd discover a great
conference in a fantastic location just a few days or weeks too late.** Once the
CFP closes, you have to wait a whole year to get back in the mix, and keeping up
with dozens of conferences is a lot of work.

Initially, I used [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/4EaSmQNr) to store
all the conferences I could find. Each week, I‚Äôd manually check on them and
update CFP dates and links as needed. It took valuable time away from the real
work of writing proposals and practicing my talk, so I thought this problem
needed a better solution.

Fortunately, other conference aggregators and CFP websites already exist, but
the killer feature that they were missing was a single weekly reminder of all
upcoming CFPs.

This seems obvious, but I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of it if I hadn‚Äôt spent months
applying for CFPs. **As a speaker, I don‚Äôt want a huge list of conferences or a
bunch of noise ‚Äî I just want a focused, weekly reminder of all the CFPs that
would be right for me.**

### The Present and the Future

In its current iteration, [CFP Land](https://www.cfpland.com/) is an email
newsletter with all the upcoming CFPs listed in chronological order. [I also
Tweet each CFP](https://twitter.com/cfp_land) when it‚Äôs due in 30 days so
followers have plenty of time to submit.

As speakers have joined, I‚Äôve gotten some great feedback, and am working on
improvements already. In the coming months, you‚Äôll be able to filter CFPs by
location, category, and whether or not travel/hotel costs are covered. I‚Äôm also
working to get more data from more sources so speakers are really sure to never
miss a CFP again.

Of course, I can‚Äôt continue improving CFP Land without input from other
speakers! If you‚Äôre a technology conference speaker and you‚Äôve got feedback,

newsletter üíå.
