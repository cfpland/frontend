When I [started CFP Land last
year](/how-cfpland-came-to-be/),
it was to help other speakers like me find out about new opportunities. In the
past few months the project has struck a chord and hundreds of speakers have
followed @[cfp_land](https://twitter.com/cfp_land) on Twitter or [subscribed to
the weekly email](https://www.cfpland.com/).

<span class="figcaption_hack">Help inspire and teach future speakers what it takes to get on the stage. Email
[karl@cfpland.com](mailto:karl@cfpland.com) to find out how.</span>

ðŸ“– Anyway, Iâ€™d like to start publishing other speakersâ€™ stories here on the blog
with **the goal of helping inspire and teach new tech conference speakers what
it takes to get up on the stage for the first time.**

After youâ€™ve given a few talks â€” or a few dozen â€” it starts to seem automatic,
but most of us can still remember that first time, the worst talk we ever gave,
or the best talk we ever gave. If youâ€™re a conference speaker, **Iâ€™d like to
publish a short interview with you on this blog.** It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™ve
spoken one time or one hundred times, someone can benefit from hearing your
story.

If youâ€™re interested, please email a short bio and link to your website to
[karl@cfpland.com](mailto:karl@cfpland.com).

I look forward to hearing your story!
