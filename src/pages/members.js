                <p>
                  Just a few dollars per month will help keep CFP Land running

            <h2 className="mt-5">Frequenty Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Why pay for a membership when I can get the newsletter for free?
              </strong>{' '}
              - Paying for a membership is totally optional, but it helps me
              keep the project going. Plus, members get access to our CFP
              Tracking and Alerting tool and early access to CFPs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can I get my company to pay for it?</strong> - Probably!
              Many members can get their company to pay for it, especially if
              speaking at conferences is part of their job.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Where do membership fees go?</strong> - Primarily they pay
              for hosting, email sending tools, and my time spent cleaning up
              the data. I have a full time job so it also helps keep me
              motivated to improve the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What features are you building next?</strong> - I have a
              ton of ideas, but I try to have a phone call with all new members
              to ask them what they want to see on the platform. Your opinion
              counts for much more when you're helping fund the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Can I get my whole team a CFP Land membership?</strong> -
              Yes! Speaking teams can get a discount on the regular monthly
              price when they add 3 or more speakers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How else can I support CFP Land?</strong> - Tell a friend,
              get your company to{' '}

                  My name is Karl, and I started CFP Land to help more
                  conference speakers get on stage. From its humble origins as a
                  simple mailing list, I am now on track to collect and share{' '}
                  <strong>over 1000 tech conference CFPs</strong> with speakers
                  on <a href="https://twitter.com/cfp_land">Twitter</a>,{' '}
                  <a href="https://www.cfpland.com/">email</a>, and{' '}
                  <a href="https://feeds.cfpland.com/v2/rss/cfps">RSS</a> for

                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, CFP Land takes a fair bit of time and money to
                  maintain. Members and sponsors help offset this cost, and
                  ensure that CFP Land will be around for many years to come. üóì
